This proposal addresses the funding of R&D.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is no existing software besides Gitcoin to publish, apply for and manage grants. Gitcoin focuses on a quadratic funding model, while there is a need for an overall indexer and management software for grants in web3.\n\nAfter reading the Builders Program post(https://forum.polkadot.network/t/builders-programs/226) on the Polkadot Forum and speaking with other members of the community (including councillors, Web3 Foundation, and members of Shokunin Network), it was evident that a grants aggregator is imperative for bringing projects into the ecosystem as well as scaling it.\n\nIn order to construct a rich and independent environment of public goods and DAOs, it is fundamental for teams to easily find and acquaint themselves with treasuries and foundations.\n\nProblem\n\nTreasuries / foundations(eg. Polkadot Treasury) are burning funds as there are not enough projects to support. \n\nGrants information and guidelines within the ecosystems are scattered and therefore difficult to find (there are only 2 places where we have a somewhat overview of these; Polkadot/Kusama documentation and Web3 Foundation Github). \n\nIt is difficult to publicly track (grant) funding for different stages of project development. This has previously resulted in conflicts within the community.\n\nThere isn’t a unified public record to privately / publicly manage and display a grant recipient’s quality and outcome of delivery (scattered documentation). \n\nWith GOV2 incoming, further research is required on tracking proposals and deliverables in order to determine the appropriate UX. \n\nSolution\n\nSuccess for Ordum is the deliverance of all milestones and a V1 POC of a public goods grant aggregator.\n\n1. A dapp which contains all grants from the ecosystems.\n\n    Index data from treasuries in the ecosystem by building custom APIs(Subsquids) for tracking proposals \n    Integrate Github in the front end for tracking and submitting non-treasury grants \n    Building and maintaining light clients for quick data retrivals, security and low loading times \n    Enable log in with multiple DID services, Github and Wallets \n\n2. Minting of non-transferable NFTs as “certificates” for completed milestones. Each token would contain information on what was executed and how it was evaluated.\n\n    Ordum will be built on Phala to leverege the chains privacy capabilities and Phat smart contracts \n    Create a connection between DID (foundation)–> Phala Smart Contract–> Non-transferable NFT–>DID (recipient) \n    Design a custom type of RMRK non-transferable NFT, stored on Crust, containing reports from the foundations on milestone delivery \n\n3. Delivery of milestones, grant applications and funding are displayed on a team’s profile for transparency.\n\n    Front end displaying funding amounts and certificates within a roadmap\n\n4. Issuing surveys and analyzing / feedback data for the purpose of aggregating and managing treasury grants in the most optimal way.\n\n    Design the optimal UX through collaboration with other teams in the ecosystem(interviews, surveys)\n\nRequested funding 78,804 USD \nKusama rate EMA7 as per 24th of November 2022: 25.24 (and reimburstment of submission and decision deposit)\n\nThe full proposal can be viewed [here](https://hackmd.io/@XyloDrone/Ordum)\n\nWe look forward to hearing your feedback.'),(530,1,5,958,2,1,34,0,'0x7ab9e626f26cdd0421442069a2e0de1a625223d78aeb8c26afad29f69c1afe71',43,16303551,15468357,'EJYeKKwU6Ua8H8TWqq85eRgAfcb1ZLneapYuR6FhRB5YgVL',100,1669296384,26.12,1670793276,'EJYeKKwU6Ua8H8TWqq85eRgAfcb1ZLneapYuR6FhRB5YgVL',16,15468367,NULL,NULL,NULL,100506,51,36979,'[Replacement for Referenda #2] Polkawatch Decentralization Analytics Parachain Support and Continued Operation.

The issue is with the slot duration migration and is specific to the Kintsugi chain configuration. No other parachains are affected. See detailed description below. \n\nThe only way to recover the chain is via a Kusama governance proposal.  \n\nNo user funds are affected as of this writing. \n\n**Current status of the network: **All operations are halted. New kBTC cannot be issued and kBTC cannot be redeemed. KINT, kBTC, KSM, LKSM, and any other currency on Kintsugi cannot be moved. There are no KINT rewards for either stakers or vaults. Collateral backing BTC is still locked but collateral thresholds are not enforced at the moment.\n\nVaults are overall very healthy (https://kintsugi.interlay.io/dashboard/vaults) and no liquidations are expected at this time. There were no pending issues or redeem requests at the time of halting. \n\nUntil Kintsugi is back online and producing blocks:\n- All exchanges have been advised to halt withdrawals \n- All XCM-connected parachains have been advised to halt XCM channels \n\n# Technical Details of the Issue \n\n## Problem\n\nThe issue was caused by a problem with the slot duration. Specifically, there is a panic when a collator tries to produce a block:\n\n```\n[Parachain] panicked at \'Timestamp slot must match `CurrentSlot`\'\n```\n\nInitially, Kintsugi was set at genesis to have a slot duration of 6 seconds but parachains typically have 12 second block times. The other chains built from the interBTC code-base (Interlay, and Interlay and Kintsugi testnets) used 12 seconds. A temporary fix was included in the Kintsugi collators to ensure that block production would succeed even with the 6 second blocktimes. The Kintsugi team did not run a migration as suggested by Parity so the temporary fix remained in place. The missing migration did not cause issues for several runtime upgrades.\n\nHowever, with the 1.20.0 runtime upgrade we included a recommended change to prevent malicious block producers from potentially building a block. Due to the missing migration, a check in the Aura hook panicked due to an incorrect slot duration calculation which prevented Kintsugi from producing blocks.\n\nCollators are not able to produce new blocks as the relay-chain validation would reject any new blocks with the updated runtime. Unfortunately, this issue was not caught during the release process, code reviews, and testnet upgrades. Also, this issue would not have been caught by the `try_runtime` testing approach as this issue is specific to collator producing blocks and the runtime migrations as such were not an issue. The issue is specific to the Kintsugi configuration and was hence not caught by the testing process on testnet. We are not aware of any other parachains being affected by this. \n\nA detailed post-mortem will be provided shortly and linked to this proposal. \n\n## Solution\n\nThere are two parts to solve this issue:\n\n1. Updating the Kintsugi runtime on Kusama: Collators are unable to produce blocks. Even by using `codeSubstitutes` Kintsugi cannot recover alone due to the bug described above. Hence, a new wasm needs to be set via Kusama governance on the relay-chain.\n2. Updating all collators on Kintsugi to use the patched wasm: Updating the Kintsugi runtime on Kusama needs to be executed together with providing all collators in the Kintsugi network a patched wasm to be used via the `codeSubstitutes` approach.\n\n# Preimage:\n\n- Para: 2092\n- newCode: https://github.com/interlay/interbtc/releases/download/1.20.0-hotfix/kintsugi_runtime_parachain.compact.compressed.wasm\nand\n\n# References\n\n- https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/5828/what-is-codesubstitutes-in-the-chain-spec\n- https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/1876'),(534,1,10,5956,7,1,11,0,'0xc23ba91bdd9fc10da1ce66edc4057334c6d1b61641ed68cae8f258e9881f064f',43,16049903,15616148,'HxyKNyZsr7gMAo2C4W4XKVt94MGLq71vJBm4Cs5YtbKgzxL',100,1670187072,29.27,1671481710,'HxyKNyZsr7gMAo2C4W4XKVt94MGLq71vJBm4Cs5YtbKgzxL',16,15616173,NULL,NULL,NULL,98111,1273,28533,'Treasury Proposal: Moderation Team Bounty Top-up','<h2>Treasury Proposal: Moderation Team Bounty Top-up</h2>\n\n<br>Hello everyone!</br>\n\n<br>With this post, we are requesting a top-up to the Moderation Team Bounty to continue funding their contributions and support to our community.</br>\n\n<br>Due to the current market conditions, we are requesting this top-up earlier than we expected.</br>\n\n<br>In addition, somes changes have been made to the initial proposal.</br>\n\n<br>All of these changes and the details of the proposal, along with spending analysis, can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFniLjcaNHc4ehJyIy0zQbWJJsEHqWuCRxX0szggPxk)</br>\n\n<br>Original Bounty Top-up Post can be found [HERE](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/bounty/14#a22a560c-fc0d-4d3c-8ff3-5890e08b79af) </br>\n\n<br>Thank you for your attention! </br>'),(535,1,11,2866,6,1,34,0,'0x581fbf796fda697e05dd559768da5291ee3a6724cd4c9db49c69ea49ac2d1b5b',43,16460818,15625631,'FsnxqJnqWVNMZZgxaQdhaCk9c5sL3WSggRCRqp1qEzk1L2i',100,1670244198,30.75,1671615516,'FsnxqJnqWVNMZZgxaQdhaCk9c5sL3WSggRCRqp1qEzk1L2i',16,15625647,NULL,NULL,NULL,143764,538,192994,'Treasury Proposal: Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Nov-22 to Jan-23','The substrate-api-client is a Rust-library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC.

Gitcoin focuses on a quadratic funding model, while there is a need for an overall indexer and management software for grants in web3.\n\nAfter reading the Builders Program [post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/builders-programs/226) on the Polkadot Forum and speaking with other members of the community (including councillors, Web3 Foundation, and members of Shokunin Network), it was evident that a grants aggregator is imperative for bringing projects into the ecosystem as well as scaling it.\n\nIn order to construct a rich and independent environment of public goods and DAOs, it is fundamental for teams to easily find and acquaint themselves with treasuries and foundations.\n\n**Problem**\n\n- Treasuries / foundations(eg. Polkadot Treasury) are burning funds as there are not enough projects to support. \n\n- Grants information and guidelines within the ecosystems are scattered and therefore difficult to find (there are only 2 places where we have a somewhat overview of these; Polkadot/Kusama documentation and Web3 Foundation Github). \n\n- It is difficult to publicly track (grant) funding for different stages of project development. This has previously resulted in conflicts within the community.\n\n- There isn’t a unified public record to privately / publicly manage and display a grant recipient’s quality and outcome of delivery (scattered documentation). \n\n- With GOV2 incoming, further research is required on tracking proposals and deliverables in order to determine the appropriate UX. \n\n**Solution**\n\nSuccess for Ordum is the deliverance of all milestones and a V1 POC of a public goods grant aggregator.\n**\nA dapp which contains all grants from the ecosystems.**\n\n- Index data from treasuries in the ecosystem by building custom APIs(Subsquids) for tracking proposals \n- Integrate Github in the front end for tracking and submitting non-treasury grants \n- Building and maintaining light clients for quick data retrivals, security and low loading times \n- Enable log in with multiple DID services, Github and Wallets\n\n**Minting of non-transferable NFTs as “certificates” for completed milestones. Each token would contain information on what was executed and how it was evaluated.**\n\n- Ordum will be built on Phala to leverege the chains privacy capabilities and Phat smart contracts \n- Create a connection between DID (foundation)–> Phala Smart Contract–> Non-transferable NFT–>DID (recipient) \n- Design a custom type of RMRK non-transferable NFT, stored on Crust, containing reports from the foundations on milestone delivery\n**\nDelivery of milestones, grant applications and funding are displayed on a team’s profile for transparency.**\n\n- Front end displaying funding amounts and certificates within a roadmap\n\n**Issuing surveys and analyzing / feedback data for the purpose of aggregating and managing treasury grants in the most optimal way.**\n\n- Design the optimal UX through collaboration with other teams in the ecosystem\n\nRequested funding 78,804 USD // 2770 KSM\nKusama rate EMA7 as per 12th of December 2022, 11.00 (and reimburstment of submission and decision deposit)\n\nThe full proposal can be viewed [here](https://hackmd.io/@XyloDrone/Ordum)\n\nWe look forward to hearing your feedback.\n'),(541,1,18,4273,6,1,34,0,'0x972dfd9262454b88a3df9e72307aa2fe65e16f0918e04c48b5053e46378f6096',43,100,15696371,'Erh2C7QY1fDiJTV7nZYyzfunzd7LPRUM21GmmXjySzSJ2WC',100,1670696658,29.93,1672155474,'EVY8RYjuB4V87pDuM25PbD5ZusVfXDkELjF2ZCN1H2keMXx',166,15718066,1672242108,24.84,NULL,97698,221,33294,'InvArch Tinkernet - Funding for a Multi-Signature Solution','The InvArch Network team seeks to provide the ecosystem with a new multi-signature solution, named Saturn, **available to every parachain & implementable throughout any dApp on those parachains**.

While sharing our proposed multi-signature implementation with other builders & community members throughout the ecosystem, we have received tremendous interest & support. We also had a meeting with a member (Ricardo) from Parity Technologies in the past regarding our solution and received positive feedback on its capabilities.\n\nThe current multi-signature implementations available for builders in the ecosystem either rely on the current implementation used in the original multi-sig Pallet developed by Parity (which is limiting) or by developing their own custom solutions (which is time-consuming & costly). The ecosystem also lacks account-recovery capabilities & the ability to onboard & off-board new members of a multi-signature implementation. This is a very restricting problem, with concerns being shared across the Kusama community. We would like to change this current reality.\n\nWhat we are proposing to build for the ecosystem is designed to service the entirety of Kusama & its parachains. We are providing it in a way that individuals will never need to purchase TNKR (optional, though) & can use KSM. **This is an open-source solution for Kusama and a solution that we truly believe will be a big boost for the ecosystem.** We are confident that if trusted by the community to deliver this solution, Kusama will go from having one of the worst multi-sig experiences in Web3 to one of the best, if not the best.

With recent issues in the crypto space regarding centralization around single providers for core network services; it is critical that the ecosystem work to decentralize all aspects of operations. By putting too much trust in any one entity we put the entire network at risk. We believe this program will work toward the goal of creating a more trustless environment with better collective oversight of network infrastructure and a high quality of service. \n\n**Service Details**\n\nExisting members of the 1000 validators program will be able to apply to this program after having achieved the necessary rankings set forth in the proposal. Accepted applicants will deploy owned server hardware in enterprise datacenter environments to provide necessary bootnodes, rpc services, snapshots, and other critical infrastructure services. These services are expected to be 100% powered by renewable energy or 100% offset by other carbon reduction strategies. Members will be paid in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service format for the various nodes they run and operate decentralized health checks for all other members as well as other aspects of network infrastructure. \n\nWe have already begun deploying and have a limited proof of concept as outlined in Program Milestone 1.  Stake Plus has teamed with 3 other 1000 validators program members located in the US, Turkey, Czech Republic, and Portugal. We are currently providing support for Westend, Kusama and Polkadot and are currently working to bring up services for Westmint, Statemine, Statemint, Encointer and Collectives. Existing services are deployed at the following locations:\n\n\n- wss://rpc.dotters.network/polkadot\n- wss://rpc.dotters.network/kusama\n- wss://rpc.dotters.network/westend\n\n\n**Funding Details**\n\nWe are requesting $1,300,000 for funding of the program milestone 2. The funds will be held in an Administrative Curator controlled 3 of 5 multi-sig wallet.

I had sought feedback via the Kusama Direction channel back then and the topic of Power of Attorney (PoA) was a clear favorite. Therefore, I have now decided to pursue that topic specifically.\n\nTo reinforce that, I got feedback from the community members that as a first step to win the community\'s trust and prove added value, it might be better to focus on a smaller funding amount and as such limit the proposal to just one article. That\'s exactly my plan now.\n\nFinally, I\'ve been told that by limiting the scope of research to the Swiss law only, the impact for the community might be reduced. As such, I\'ve decided to expand the scope and focus on building a general legal framework to regulate on-chain PoA. The authorities (especially in Europe) will face the same types of challenges when dealing with digitising the legal system and I aim to provide a framework and guidelines for addressing these issues from first principles (both legal and technological). In order to ground my research in a practical environment and not just theoretical constructs, I will use the Swiss juridical system to provide examples where appropriate.\n\nYou can find the full proposal on [my GitHub](https://github.com/legal-julia/power-of-attorney-on-polkadot).

We are Evrloot. The first RPG based on RMRK NFTs that managed to deliver a playable game.\n\nBy sending your souls (thats what we call our in game characters) to wallets of ours, you can start missions that can yield\nrewards in the form of new NFTs. \n\nWe have minted over 90% of all existing RMRK NFTs on Kusama to date and 99% of them come from rewards that players got from going on missions.\n\nThere are approximately 2000 missions started each day. \n\nWith the recent changes in fee calculation by Gavin Wood himself in referendum 254 (https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/254) our game\nwas forced to shut down almost immediately. With an active playerbase of around 120 players, we had daily minting fees of around\n1 KSM. Earning royalties from our NFTs was barely enough to cover those costs. But since fees increased by a factor of 10, we are not able to \nmaintain our game anymore.\n\nSince there is no way for us to let the players mint the NFTs for themselves without Smart Contracts or Pallets, we need to do it for them and cover the costs.\n\nWe also dont want to charge the players for playing the game. We are not talking about some cents, but multiple dollars per day to play a blockchain game.\n\nTo give some perspective on how much it would cost the players if they were to cover:\n\nA player with 2 Souls and an average of 4 Missions/soul/day and two trades would be paying around 2.8$/daily (ca. 1,2$ for missions + 0.80$ for sending souls and resources + 0.80$ for trading)\nA player with 10 souls and an average of 8 Missions/soul and five trades around 22$/daily\n\nThese costs are too high in our opinion and after a vote in our discord server, the community agrees.\n\nThe proposed 333 KSM would last for approximetly 1 month. After that we would need to reapply for funding.\n\nWith the advancements in RMRK 3.0 on Smart Contracts we are soon migrating to Moonbeam to hopefully find a even bigger playerbase and further decentralize.\n\nThis means the funding would be applied for the period between now and the migration to Moonbeam.\n\nThe KSM from the treasury would be used to pay the gas fees required to keep the game running. So its entirety would go back into the system.\n\nNever heard of us?

I hope it will be a great one for everybody.  This will be my last response to this topic. While I like the idea of discussions, this is taking up too much time and space in my mind. It is hindering me on what I actually want to do, which is building and delivering to the people. Building not only benefits our players, but the space and Kusama as a whole and wasting energy on discussions like this will not get us anywhere. I can only repeat it again: This proposal is not a compensation for our efforts of pushing the boundries of Kusama and RMRK, this is simply a proposal to help us bench the costs for a short transition period, where not a single cent goes into our pockets, but everything comes full circle in the ecosystem. I am more than happy to have you in a public twitter space or in a discord call, so reach out if you are willing to do that.  \n\nAnyway, let me go through your claims one by one.\n\n  „I find it haughty to think RMRK is the sole reason for governance activity on Kusama. It certainly helped bring user into the ecosystem but it\'s not the one thing bringing all users to Kusama.“\n\n  I never said RMRK is the sole reason for governance activity. But I am pretty sure even you will agree, that governance participation will not noticeably increase with even greater advancements of technology on a chain, but rather by people who love products that live on a chain and are passionate about being a part of governing the ecosystem those products live in. Non technical people dont care as much about the tech as we do, they want to enjoy their experiences and be a part of something that feels fun and they can identify with.\n\n  „Let me get this straight, you want Kusama to front the bill for a small minority of token holders to continue farming rewards from your game until you can migrate your whole userbase away from Kusama and onto Moonbeam? Why should KSM holders vote to fund anything with an explicit plan to abandon the chain?“  \n\nThe game is on Kusama, the players are on Kusama. The fees are paid on the Kusama chain. I am not sure what your point is here. Would your opinion change if we had 1000 players? Would that player base be big enough to rationalize it for you? This gives me real - being rude to the waiter but extra friendly when the restaurant owner comes to the table - vibes, maybe thats just me though. Like you already said, we are migrating because our operations turned out to be unsustainable over night, and we are migrating. Make of that what you want. We love the dotsama space and the tech behind it. We could probably go to Ethereum and earn a multiple of revenue than we are doing right now, because we are actually delivering something. But we love the ecosystem and the people here and at least for me Kusama and Polkadot is one big family\n\n  „You are quite literally asking for funding. All because you\'re using the funds in a certain way doesn\'t mean you\'re not asking for funding.“\n\n  I could have worded that better. What I meant was that we are not asking for funding of our project and the time cost that is involved in that. We are not asking for thousands of development hours being compensated with 100+$ each. And trust me, there are thousands of hours put into Evrloot.\n\n  „While I agree the fee change was jarring and was sort of a \"rider bill\" on Referendum 14, it certainly wasn\'t something that came with only 3 hours notice - very misleading. Referendum 14 was submitted at block #15,657,166 and was approved at block #15,680,413 for a total time of 41 hours. If you\'re going with the first publication of the fee change, Gavin merged the change on December 4th 10:51am UTC, nearly 5 days before it was enacted on-chain. Also, if you remember in ~Q2 of 2021, the fees were reduced 10x when KSM was worth 10 times its current price. To say you weren\'t expecting this fee to return to its original amount after KSM lost 10x its value is, with all due respect, simply naïve. It was written on the walls.“  \n\nI agree that we could go through each and every proposal that gets published and probably even follow Gavins commits on github and try to understand every line he writes. But in practice, this is not what we do. One the one hand because there are only 24 hours in a day and every person in our team is working a full time job „on the side“. On the other hand I dont feel like this should be our responsibility. Isnt this what the whole Parachain thought is about? Having something you can trust on, build on top and dont have to waste pressure time on. I am personally relatively new to this space and did not expect the fees to 10x, maybe I should have, looking out for stuff like this in the future. We are trying really hard to be as up to date in this space as we can, but it feels overwhelming even for us.  Your argument that there would have been anything we could have moved in this proposal is just as naïve as our thought that a test chain is there to allow people to test stuff and not constantly worry about running out of KSM to pay gas fees.  \n\n„Claim: Evrloot has minted 90% of all existing RMRK NFTs\nTruth: This figure is actually ~35%, yet unique holders of Evrloot NFTs only make up ~1.44% of all unique RMRK NFT holders.“  This was admittedly a wrong stat. What I had in mind is a statistic we tweeted about a few weeks ago:\n\n[twitter post]( https://twitter.com/EVRL00T/status/1578715277940097024/photo/1  \n)\nWhere we were minting close to 90% of all NFTs. But thats obviously just a 7D capture and not all time. Maybe I should have focused more on the utility we are offering, total minted NFTs is a stupid stat to go for anywhere, anybody can do that with minimal experience in javascript and enough KSM. What matters is what your NFT can do, which is our strong suit. Sorry for that.\n\nNow lets get to the provable wrong statements of yours.\n\n  „Claim: Active userbase of 120 users\nTruth: Since block #15,000,000, 67 wallets were responsible for 90% of all non-team Evrloot SEND interactions“\n\n  I love that you took the time to analyze this and even printed out the list of all users that sent evrloot NFTs, because its even more than I thought. So we had 196 non-evrloot-wallet senders since block #15000000 . Every game EVER has a small amount of players put in the most amount of time and effort and the rest of the playerbase gradually investing less and less time compared to those. Obviously it wont be any different for us. Lets say 60% of those wallets, that sent evrloot NFTs, are actually players (why would they not, they can use their NFTs and get more for basically free by playing our game -> UTILITY), thats pretty much exactly 120 players. What I based my number on is unique wallets starting missions through our frontend on a daily basis. I am pretty sure most game studios go with users per month on this important stat, but we went with unique active DAILY wallets. And now we even have the blockchain data to prove it.  \n\n„Claim: Users with 10 souls spend $22 per day\nTruth: There are only 4 wallets spending this much per day with a high cost estimate per SEND interaction and absolutely no wallets spending this much with low cost estimate per SEND interaction„\n\n  There is a fundamental aspect wrong here (READ THE PROPOSAL):  \n\nI never said a player with 10 souls is spending 22$ per day. It says „If the players were to cover“! We are paying for all Minting fees related to our games, plus sending back the souls of the players back after the mission finished. Thats why we had to stop the game, we couldnt pay for these fees anymore. This is not about the send remarks players are creating. But since you did the calculation: Its insane that 4 wallets are already paying over 22$ per day ONLY for sending. This is about covering the minting costs and send remarks that are created on our side! A send remark is one of the cheapest remarks you can create on Kusama because of its relatively small size. What we are doing is minting NFTs for them based on the results of a mission. Minting one of our Fish for example (our most popular collection) takes not only 2 completely separate extrinsics, because of the way remark minting works, but its also approx. 14 times its size -> MINT (almost the same as send) - 3 RESADDS (one resource for a nice thumb on singular, one for our game, one to be equippable -> every single one being 4 times the size of a send) - SEND of the NFT to the player. Minting a fish costs us around 20 cents. And we dont have NFTs with 60 resources, like the abomination of NFTs you created, Adam.  \n\n„Claim: Users think these fees are too expensive and are unwilling to pay them\nTruth: Current holders of Evrloot NFTs have endured a total net loss of 958 KSM on Evrloot NFTs so far. Clearly, users have no issue spending KSM on Evrloot. You also hosted a poll in your discord which does not verify Evrloot NFT ownership, so we have no way of knowing if your poll is actually the will of Evrloot NFT holders.“\n\nWhat is this statistic supposed to mean? We had an initial sale volume of around 3k KSM in total from our very first collection, the Book of Lore and our Souls. So per your definition that would be a 3k KSM total net loss for Evrloot players? Following this definition, players actually were able to recuperate over 2k KSM by new players joining in and them being willing to pay rising floor prices because the demand rose and the utility we offer.  If this is your actual definition and viewpoint I actually find it really sad how you view this whole space. While paying for a dinoxdino egg was, in my opinion, quite the net loss, I dont think purchasing a soul of ours is. You actually get something. You get utility, an ingame on chain marketplace, a merchant that offers trades to you on a daily basis, new content at least once a month. You dont get empty promises and month of not hearing anything. \nFor the discord poll: Nice try in getting us to use your rmrk dao site again, but no thanks :) \n\n  Regarding Moonbeam and your opinion of them needing to help us cover this difficult period:  \n\nThe amount of support and help from a technical, business and personal perspective from their Moonbeam council and Derek himself, is already a multitude higher than anything we experienced here.  \n\nAddressing Paradox, because I want to comment on two of his/her concerns:  \n\nHi Paradox,  \n\n„The proposal is not well presented and on the surface it just seems to be adapted to gain the maximum allowance of the track. Dare I say that Adam presented a better counter with his responses.“  \n\nNot sure what you mean with Adams counter. Having the Moonbeam foundation cover? They will say the exact same thing Adam is saying right now: „The game is not on our chain and neither is the current gameplay“. Where we are though, is Kusama. We are not milking Kusama for anything. We want to provide something for the users of the chain and thats the chain we are asking to cover those expenses.  \n\n„I agree with the position that the relay-chain should not be conflicted with non-essential activities, likes games. It is primarily designed for chain security and fees should be adapted in adherence to this principle.“\n\n  While I understand this position I hope you can understand ours as well. We loved RMRK and what they were building and wanted to create something ourselves. While their advancements to EVMs and Pallets and thus Polkadot are finally happening, back in March, Kusama was the only way to start building with RMRK. We were RMRK first from the beginning and still are, so this limitation effectively hindered us at starting this anywhere else. We could have obviously waited a year more for the dependencies to be ready, but thats not how we operate and thats never going to be how we operate. We want to build cool stuff, do it as fast and good as possible. If that means Kusama, we will be on Kusama, if that means Moonbeam, we will be on Moonbeam. We would much rather deliver something at 80% perfection and create cool experiences for everyone involved, than to crawl towards the unachievable 100% and waste precious time and resources.\n\n  „Should the relay-chain treasury pay for a project that adopted a poor business model? I think this proposal is best suited for the destination SC chain in this case Moonbeam.“  \n\nThis was never really about the business model. While we do have multiple approaches to earn revenue from cosmetics, the marketplace, potential new souls when the playerbase grows, we first need to focus on delivering a pleasant experience. Selling eggs and letting buyers wait for a year before anything happens is horrible in my opinion, but is the business model of 90% of other collections in this space.

🎆 I\'m Daniel, long time builder in the ecosystem, Senior ambassador,\n*humble fellow* of the Polkadot fellowship and team lead of the Virto team of the\n[Virto Network][LI]. \n\nThis proposal is about **supporting us** the Virto team(more than a roadmap or specific project), we are a\ncreative and very capable group of individuals with great track record building multiple projects in the ecosystem\nwith funds from the treasuries and Web3 foundation(piggy bank too): \n- [`Sube` + `Scales`][SB]: 20,000 EUR https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/616\n- [`orml-payments`][PY]: 36,000 kUSD https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/lip_payments.md\n- [`libwallet`][WL]: 28,800 USD https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/825\n- [Fido][FD] PoC: 69,750 USD https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/246\n\nIt hasn\'t been the easiest building this way but we believe developing with the ecosystem \nfunds for the ecosystem is the right way to go specially when creating out of the box solutions in the best Kusama style. \n\nWe have several exiting projects lined up for 2023 ready for development with the \nmain theme theme of making blockchain technology extremely accessible to the\nnon-crypto-native 99% of the population.\n\n#### 2023 Projects overview\n- **Summa**: *Substrate Meets Matrix*, a lightweight multi-chain capable node extensible with \nWebAssemply plugins, integrated with Matrix(decentralized communications protocol that powers Element)\nto interact with Substrate blockchains via the messaging protocol.  \n	- **Summa pallet**: A blockchain module to create a tighter integration with Substrate, \n	take on-chain actions based on Matrix events, control Matrix rooms/communities on-chain or \n	seamlessly use Matrix accounts and multiple devices with your blockchain. \n- **Hardware prototyping**: A limited edition handcrafted wood-leather key ring prototype of \na *hardware wallet you can lose* without fear of losing your funds.\n- **Valor**: *Virto\'s async lightweight open runtime*, the plugin system and developer platform \nthat powers Summa, our super app and hardware wallets. \n- **FiDOS Super app**: Web application(no special installation needed) extensible with WASM applets,\nit integrates with merchant\'s web sites for example and it would include apps to manage your summa node and hardware wallets.\n- Further development and improvements to Sube, Scales, Libwallet and other related projects.\n- **[Kreivo][KV] Parathread**: The tokenless sister chain of Virto Network for payments of real-world\n products and services that empowers local communities with its tax collection system.\n  - [SwapCash][SC]: An initial use-case of a real world marketplace for decentralized on&off-ramps.\n  - [The Federation][TF]: A Fellowship-like ranked collective, an extract of the *Local Incentives Protocol* \n  that attempts to bring the ambassador program on-chain and turn its members into local leaders that can better represent the interests of KSM/DOT holders.  \n- **Dot.Builders(new - extra credits assignment)**: PoC of a ranked collective that would allow teams that\nare committed to bring long term value to Kusama and Polkadot to have easier \nrecurrent access to treasury funds in an automated way based on their reputation\nlevel and previous accomplishments to avoid going through the somewhat inefficient\nand clumsy process of individual proposals, referenda and the micromanagement culture \nthat results from this kind of process :)\n\nThe highlights and priorities for 2023 are Summa and the Hardware wallet as they can have a \nbigger impact short term. Before rushing out a blockchain with no utility into \nexistence we want to focus on experimenting with different forms of user interaction that result\nfamiliar and intuitive to the broad audience. \nWe have been laying down the foundations of a technology stack we believe can tackle\nthe many issues the industry is facing to attract mass adoption without \ncompromising decentralization, trying to make the technology extremely accessible,\nsimple to use, cheap and overall remove as many entry barriers as possible, such as:\n\n- Abstract blockchain protocols. The average Moe doesn\'t care about them.\n- Hide away cryptography. i.e. say goodbye to seed phrases.  \n- Be familiar. Metaverses, NFTs, Staking, etc. are cool new concepts but\nintimidating for the 99% of non-crypto savvy population which is our focus(let\'s first grow the pie!). \n- Speak our users language. Avoid new jargon and words that need explanation.\n- Universal and cheap, don\'t assume everyone has capable smartphone, knows how \nto install a browser extension or has good(or any?) internet connectivity.\n- Fear of the unknown. Regardless of the intrinsic security of blockchain,\ntrusting your life\'s savings to new technology is scary.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Virto Stack<sub>*(projects detail)*</sub>\n\nTo serve the use cases we aim for we\'ve gone a long way creating a technology stack from scratch that\nputs a lot of focus on user/developer experience and very lightweight, simple, power/memory efficient, WASM friendly libraries\nthat can *run everywhere*, this aids in our long term vision to really bringing blockchain technology to the masses, specially empowering regular users in areas where digitization and technology penetration is low and people might have never heard the word blockchain, there is an opportunity to provide inexpensive hardware and efficient software to connect people to Web3 services.\n\n> ℹ️ Road-map is subject to change, estimates of times and human resources(engineering, design, user research, etc.) \nare approximate and team members(12+ people) will be dynamically allocated to the right project on a need basis.\n\n## Valor\n[github.com/virto-network/valor](https://github.com/virto-network/valor)\n\n![Valor roadmap][T1]\n\n*Virto\'s async lightweight open runtime*, is a WebAssembly runtime abstraction that based on a target platform selects an appropriate WASM compiler(e.g. Wasm3 in embedded devices, Wasmtime for servers, etc). Using the upcoming \"Web Assembly component model\" we define or make use of existing host interfaces to expose different capabilities to the plugins that are loaded on an internal registry and are supervised in case plugins were to fail.\n\nAn important aspect of Valor is to be developer friendly, have enough tooling and define easy to use interfaces so developers can create new plugins in no time without complications.\n\n![Valor architecture][VA]\n\n## Summa\n\n[github.com/virto-network/summa-node](https://github.com/virto-network/summa-node)\n\n![Summa roadmap][T2]\n\n*Substrate meets Matrix* is the implementation of a Matrix homeserver and Smoldot based node developed in Rust that can compile to WebAssembly to run in the browser. The Matrix and blockchain functionality are developed as WASM components running on top of Valor, WASM runtime and message broker that routes incoming messages to the blockchain component and other user provided plugins.\n\nThe node is distributed as a lightweight single binary easy to deploy with support for multiple blockchains(thanks to Sube). It is great as a personal cloud and easy entry point for users to the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystems as users only need simple WebAuthN or phone number authentication, it provides encrypted communications out of the box including access to any public Matrix channels(all official communication channels in the ecosystem that are hosted by Parity and the Web3 foundation use this protocol).  \nBuilding on top of the Matrix account and device management system means users only ever need a friendly MXID(e.g. `@olanod:virto.community`) to send funds to a friend, multiple devices are supported and even multiparty signature support in case you want to require transactions to be confirmed with a different device or a hardware wallet. \nWith Matrix built-in [*Secure Secret Storage and Sharing*][SS] protocol there is also an out-of-the-box solution for secure account backups and arbitrary user secrets.\nFinally more functionalities are available when installing different plugins that can turn your node into a decentralized notification system or a personal bot assistant that can sign transactions on your behalf. \n\n![Summa arch][SU]\n\n## Hardware wallet prototype\n\n![Wallet prototype roadmap][T3]\n\nHardware development is hard and designing crypto wallets to keep in a cold storage with your life\'s savings makes things even harder as there are a lot of security considerations in their fabrication that increase their price, but it doesn\'t have to be that way. At Virto we think there is need for a new category of wallets, small cheap devices that are meant to be carried around without the fear that losing them means losing our funds.\n\nAs part of our previous work on the Fido prototype we added support for new kinds of back-ends to libwallet and created a simple device that can be used to confirm and sign transactions with the push of a button. Continuing with this idea, we want bring the Virto Stack to inexpensive and commonly available hardware modules, keeping the \"artistic\" style(wood+leather for the next experiment) and assemble a limited amount of devices to be given away later this year.\n\nThe next iteration of the software would be more complex as we will make several optimizations across the stack to fit Valor and other plugins that effectively turn the device into a Matrix client so it can respond to messages in a chat room(e.g. \"please sign this transaction\"), we would add support for multi-party signatures, a kind of multi-sig that doesn\'t require sending transactions to the blockchain, so your device can serve as second confirmation factor or the only factor when transacting with small amounts.\n\nLastly we want to include, at least in a few prototypes, a LoRaWAN capable chip that allows transmitting small amounts of data over long distances that we would use to test the design of an accurate-enough *proof of location protocol* useful for location sensitive protocols like LIP(or Encointer). This technology is good in places with bad connectivity where users could broadcast a signed transaction to a nearby station(e.g. kiosk,point of sale,neighbor) that submits the transaction on their behalf.\n\n![Fido Primero][F1]\n(We promise next prototypes will be prettier than *Fido Primero*)\n\n## Kreivo\n\n[github.com/virto-network/virto-node](https://github.com/virto-network/virto-node)\n\n![Kreivo roadmap][T4]\n\nKreivo means creativity, the best virto(virtue) of Kusama 😉 It\'s the first implementation of the *Local Incentives Protocol*, our initial effort to bring the the ecosystem closer to a more general non technical audience by providing a place where people can easily form/join communities to conduct real world economic activities that create utility for the ecosystem tokens, such as setting up marketplaces where local merchants or service providers can make a fair living transacting in KSM, or with stable coins.\n\nLIP focuses on making decentralized local businesses be socially responsible without compromising their profitability, a dynamic tax system enables the collection of resources that empower local communities to become their own autonomous micro-economies as well as the fair usage of collected resources for other common good causes like addressing climate change or inequality among others.\n\nFrom the start LIP was designed for a token-less, yet sustainable blockchain. We prefer this design as governance is not in the hands of a few VCs or team members and it can bring more value to Kusama and to the commercial communities that struggle to attract value to their tokens. The real value of the network will come from the real world use cases that find their home in Kreivo(and later Virto) that will have the incentive to develop and sustain the common shared infrastructure.\n\n### A parachain powered by `orml-payments`\n\nIn practice Kreivo would work in a similar way as Statemine which is built\naround the `pallet-assets` and `pallet-uniques`. Our parachain instead has \n`orml-payments` as its core functionality, we built the pallet with the support \nof a Web3 grant and later brought to a wider audience by successfully merging to\nthe well known ORML community repository. This Substrate module is what makes \npossible to securely pay for products and services thanks to its built-in \nescrow-like system with refunds, disputes among other features that also include\nthe dynamic fee collection system that communities will use to generate local \nand global impact.\n\n### Governance\n\nKreivo/Virto\'s governance would be delegated to the Collectives parachain in the future \nwhere we wish to launch the *Trade Association* and [*The Federation*][TF], a ranked collective \nformed by local/regional leaders that serve as delegates of the many DOT holders spread around the globe.\nTogether with the relay-chain\'s governance the three bodies can dictate the fate of different\naspects of the chain.\n\n### Some use cases\n\n#### Decentralized on/off-ramps\n\nCurrent experience for attracting new users is very poor in the ecosystem as most people\nhave to resort to centralized exchanges that are not easily available in every \npart of the world and require cumbersome verification processes.\nVirto team\'s first show case for the technology is *swap.cash*, a fiat-to-crypto\nmarketplace that benefits from the payments pallet and built-in decentralized \ncommunications to offer a seamless Uniswap-like experience and embeddable \n*Swap API* for developers that want to on-board new users to the ecosystem by\nfor example allowing fiat payments to merchants that are payed in a stable\ncoin.\n\n#### d-commerce\n\nThe most compelling use case for Kreivo and Virto in the long term is likely\ndecentralized commerce, which is not just traditional e-commerce plus crypto\npayments, we see d-commerce as a way to put together under the same roof a\nuniverse of composable real-world economies where people trade in a more\ntransparent and fair way that puts users and communities in control, where\nthere are clearly defined rules(in the form of code) on how wealth is responsibly\ndistributed for the overall community\'s sake, for common good causes and\nultimately for the users themselves that are owners of the very same products\nthe use.\n\n## FiDOS Super APP\n\n[github.com/virto-network/fido](https://github.com/virto-network/fido)\n\n![FiDOS roadmap][T5]\n\nA decentralized chat-centric super-app for the Web(not an extension), desktop and mobile. It\'s the go-to graphical interface for \"Virto products\", same as the hardware wallets it is a Matrix client in disguise with the ability to extend its features with WebAssembly plugins. One can install new applets or *teach new tricks*(mini overlay applets) from repositories maintained by the community.\nOver time we will add more official applets and UI components to make it very simple for other users to develop new functionality.  \n\n![FiDOS App][SA]\n\n## Scales\n\n[github.com/virto-network/scales](https://github.com/virto-network/scales)\n\n![Scales roadmap][T6]\n\nMaking use of type information this library allows conversion to/from SCALE encoded data without allocating an intermediate representation, specially useful when conversion is for dynamic types like JSON.\n\n## Sube\n\n[github.com/virto-network/sube](https://github.com/virto-network/sube)\n\n![Sube roadmap][T7]\n\nA client library and CLI for Substrate chains with reduced API(one `sube` function) and a big focus on size and portability so it can run in constrained environments like the browser.\n\nMaking use of the type information in a chain\'s metadata(powered by Scales), Sube allows automatic conversion between the SCALE binary format used by the blockchain with a human-readable representation like JSON without having to hardcode types for each network. When submitting extrinsics Sube delegates the responsibility of signing the payload of a transaction to an external tool(e.g. libwallet).  \nSube supports multiple backends under different feature flags like http, http-web or ws/wss, with the planned support for smoldot.\n\nWhen paired with Valor, Sube can be exposed as an HTTP API that runs both in the server and the browser and be composed with other plugins to create higher level APIs that a client application can use from any platform thanks to the ubiquitousness of HTTP. We imagine existing centralized projects easily integrating with Substrate blockchains in the server with the option to progressively migrate to a decentralized set-up with the whole back-end later running in the user device(e.g. web browser). More interestingly it can be used for *progressive decentralization* to give users the the best user experience, a Sube powered application can start being served from a server to have an immediate response and 0 start-up time and since plugins can be hot-swapped, the blockchain back-end can be switched from HTTP to light node transparently without the application code ever realizing, giving our users with bad connectivity and slower devices the opportunity to enjoy the best possible user experience without compromising decentralization.\n\n## Libwallet\n\n[github.com/virto-network/libwallet](https://github.com/virto-network/libwallet)\n\n![Libwallet roadmap][T8]\n\nA lightweight and very portable library with simple to understand and use abstractions that allow creating chain-agnostic crypto wallets able to run in all kinds of environments like native applications, hosted wallets, the browser or even embedded hardware.  \nWe have been adding support for multiple backends and will continue to do so specially for different hardware modules with varying interfaces and architectures. \n\nAfter adding EVM and Bitcoin accounts support and thanks to the ability of a libwallet client to queue transactions before signing, we imagine\ninteresting cross chain use cases like sending BTC to a bridge and sign a Substrate transaction at the same to avoid the problem of using multiple wallets and multiple confirmations. \n\n# Team and costs\n\nThe Virto team has been working on an ad-hoc basis in a not very sustainable way, with concurrent members ranging \nanywhere from 2 to 8 depending on availability of resources. However the pool of team members ready to jump full time in the\nproject to deliver milestones on time is around 12+ people assuming economic stability is guaranteed.\n\nWe can count on:\n\n[DO]: https://github.com/olanod\n[DB]: https://github.com/S0c5\n[PA]: https://github.com/pandres95\n[JV]: https://github.com/JorgeVV\n[NB]: https://github.com/nbari\n[JD]: https://github.com/johandroid\n[ST]: https://github.com/stanly-johnson\n[MA]: https://github.com/manuelcastrobarinas\n[BV]: https://github.com/b-avb\n[RO]: https://de.linkedin.com/in/robjalkh\n\n- 1 team lead ([Daniel][DO])\n- 4 Senior software engineers ([David][DB], [Pablo][PA], [Jorge][JV], Stanly*)\n- 1 Expert Devops engineer ([Nicolas][NB])\n- 1 Embedded engineer ([Johan][JD])\n- 2 Mid-level engineers ([Bryan][BV], Gabi*)\n- 1 Junior engineer ([Manuel][MA])\n- 1 All in one senior designer ([Roberto][RO])\n- 1 User researcher (Edith)\n- 1 Economist (Q.C.)\n- 1 Content creator (Camila)\n\n> \\* needs confirmation.   \n> ℹ️ More *virtuous* members can join our next phase of development with enough work for everyone but for now this is a size we are comfortable with given the limited amount of funds requested.\n\nThe average monthly cost per person is around 3,000+ USD, a 9 months budget for the team ranges from **324,000 to 378,000 USD**.  \nWith the requested 20,000 KSM at a price of 23.5USD/KSM(EMA7) that would equal 470,000 USD, minus 10K of operational costs(infrastructure, hardware wallet materials and equipment) and leaving a 20% buffer to account for price fluctuations, missed deadlines and other (un)expected circumstances we are left with **368,000 USD**.  Worst case scenario if things don\'t go as bad as usual, there will be extra funds to bring some more awesomeness to Kusama.\n\n**EDIT:** more info on the team budget and how it compares to market salaries in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TEYrYIDi_4J3xfHK7CiHZaCTM695VXD0cvmtj_w874s/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nA note from experience, since we are in the wild west I think exact budgets don\'t work(hence the beautiful rounded 20K KSM), we have **always** lost money, sometimes more than 30% of received funds, we made mistakes and learned a lot but it hasn\'t been because of financial ineptitude but because building in the crypto space is tricky, a lot of times it\'s crazy price fluctuations but it can also be due to swapping funds to a not-so-stable stable coin for example, a lot can happen!

For example, parachains can configure their XCMP routing to interpret `parents: 2` (indicating, \"go to another consensus system\") as something to send to the BH to handle. Likewise, the BH can handle incoming messages and route them to the correct parachain within Kusama.\n\nOnce operational, a Polkadot<>Kusama bridge will allow more interaction between the networks.

After receiving positive feedback on the related [discussion post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2091), we are now creating this proposal for the **remaining funding** (9200 Euros).*\n\n*9200 Euros = 9824 USD*\n\n*Using the EMA7: 24.65 USD/KSM*\n\n*9824 / 24.65 = 398.5 KSM*\n\n#### The dashboard is split into 3 parts\n\n**Main dashboard**\n\nPresents the most important statistics to show insightful trends.\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/vB1cvPT\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/3s1TYNj/Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-22-44.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-22-44\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n**Single referendum view**\n\nDisplays all relevant information for a specific referendum.\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/ZgCqT88\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/qgwT1ss/Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-51-54.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-51-54\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n**Single account view**\n\nProvides insights into the voting behaviour of a specific wallet.\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/Wy8Gk1h\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/VSnJg81/Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-54-36.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-54-36\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n------------------\n<br />\n\nWe initially projected delivery to be in July 2022 and sincerely apologise for the **delay**. While work commenced immediately, we were not fully satisfied with previous iterations. Note that this project was largely executed by data analyst Claudia Yuan as to allow the existing devs for the Proof of Chaos project to keep focused on our other efforts.\n\n### Explanation of the design choices:\n\n--------------\n<br />\n\nFor the dashboard we built a custom [SubSquid indexer](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Chaos/indexer) that indexes all relevant governance data in real-time. You can query the data [here](https://squid.subsquid.io/referenda-dashboard/v/0/graphql).\n\n**Drawbacks**:\n\n1. Subsquid indexers are currently still running on **centralized** servers.\n2. The indexer needs to be updated each time there is a **runtime upgrade** with **breaking changes** to the existing logic. \n\n##### *Centralisation*\n\nCurrently all Subsquid indexers are running on the company\'s servers. While Subquery may have a more decentralized product, we still went with Subsquid due to the ease and speed of development with their solution. The support received from the Subsquid team as well as their commitment to the Polkadot Ecosystem also played a significant role in our decision. Note that Subsquid is working towards decentralisation.\n\n##### *Breaking changes through Runtime upgrades*\n\nThis should be less of an issue as the Kusama network becomes more stable and runtime upgrades become \"less invasive\".\n\n\n\n--------------\n<br />\n\nFor the [frontend](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Chaos/dashboard) we went with a Python Framework called Dash. While this helped us to build quicker, it limited us in flexibility. This route was chosen due to Claudia\'s familiarity with Python.\n\n--------------\n<br />\n\n### Continuation of the project...\n\nWe are of course interested in extending the dashboard to also include **OpenGov** (Gov2) data. This would be required to measure the effect of our incentivisation efforts going forward. It would involve updating the indexer to incorporate all OpenGov events + extrinsics as well as adapting the front-end to the new type of data (charts/filtering by tracks etc.).\n\nFeel free to also throw any **feature requests** you may have in the comments of the [discussion post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2091).

An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public Archive Registry\n# Achievements\nAt the end of Q2 Subsquid released a new generation of Archives, together with a major version of the SDK, both code named “Fire Squid”.\nThe improvements brought by this release include:\n- Substantial performance increase, with the ability to deploy a new Archive for a chain as big as Kusama, and the indexing to be ready in roughly a day\n- Fire Squid Archives support batch requests, which lead to a hundredfold increase in performance of indexing project connecting to them (squids)\n- Fire Squid Archives expose two separate gateways, configured and tuned for different uses (one for data exploration by humans, the other one specifically for programmatic and batch access)\n- Fire Squid Archives “unwrap” proxy, sudo and batch calls, tracing the origin, but making them much easier to access them\nSubsquid has also engaged in continuously improving the product, iteratively working on adding features, such as EVM Transactions indexing, and subscriptions to queries in the Graphql endpoints of indexing projects created with the Subsquid SDK (commonly called squids).\n# Statistics\nBetween 2022-09-03 (when tracking has started) and 2022-09-30 Subsquid’s Archive infrastructure has collectively:\n- Served a total of 129,468,038.2 (~129 million) queries in the month of September alone\n- Our 7 day average peaks above 5 million queries and adjusts around 3.3 million queries per day at the end of the period\nData from the month of October confirms the linear trend, allowing us to make assumptions for the months of July and August, given the steady growth of queries over time shown.\n\nFull report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQji6zUckBRq3Q8H0xOSLjmFDUkKHckt9SiSIIMdCw_Ck_qpiAhFltGxnNavCmFJcebiBznKO_dleis/pub)'),(584,1,65,32916,4,1,33,0,'0xb5e7433c60187d867d1f7053790da46ecdaa06c4516e55a517c8c37fe4814573',43,100,16189082,'DG8Q1VmFkmDwuKDN9ZqdB78W6BiXTX5Z33XzZNAykuB5nFh',0,1673712504,30.92,NULL,'DG8Q1VmFkmDwuKDN9ZqdB78W6BiXTX5Z33XzZNAykuB5nFh',6,16191482,NULL,NULL,NULL,252,99345,82,'AIWeb3 Chinese Unit proposal (爱Web3 中文社区提案)  -   PLEASE REJECT THIS, the amount of KSM is not correct!','Please reject this proposal, the amount requested is not correct. \n\nPlease vote on this one instead:\n\n**[https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/66](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/66)**'),(585,1,66,3291,4,1,33,0,'0x4385b65d777984e8d295663b068157cde098ee50636e57f78da9640a345ea8ec',43,100,16189661,'DG8Q1VmFkmDwuKDN9ZqdB78W6BiXTX5Z33XzZNAykuB5nFh',0,1673715990,30.91,1674906810,'DG8Q1VmFkmDwuKDN9ZqdB78W6BiXTX5Z33XzZNAykuB5nFh',6,16192061,1674993456,36.91,NULL,88987,10178,20774,'AIWeb3 Chinese Unit proposal (爱Web3 中文社区提案)','Hello everyone in DotSama community, happy new year! \n\nThis is DrCAO, I am Ex. community manager at Parallel Finance and Para Space, and also director of Chinese community in WagMedia under Bounty 12.

The mission of the AiWeb3 Chinese community is to continue building the community to support the Chinese content creators to focus on content creation in Dotsama, build connections for different parachain projects, and provide the latest information in Dotsama.

Problem**\n\nSince the launch of Governance 2.0 on Kusama I spent many hours reading, reviewing, and trying to understand many treasury discussions and proposals. I try my best to understand every proposal before forming an opinion and voting. For the majority of the proposals, I try to provide feedback to the proposer explaining the reasons for either supporting or rejecting the proposal. So far I feel like proposals are sort of a wild game at the moment.\n\nMost proposals are not very well structured, lack information, and include budgets that seem very hard to defend. Proposals can also be very diverse with a focus on different areas that not everyone can be familiar with. For all these reasons it is significantly time-consuming for voters to truly understand the proposal and cast an educated vote on it.\n\nWith the given time constraints, it is not surprising that proposals are receiving very little or no feedback at all. The feedback is often provided in a free form and is not always clear and precise. Such insufficient information has little use for other voters. It provides low assurance to other community members that the reviewer has objectively formed an objective opinion on the presented proposals.\n\n**2. Available solutions**\n\nThe official Polkadot treasury page, Kusama and Polkadot Wiki provide a good source of information and documentation. Most of this information and guidelines explain the “old” Governance 1.0 system or in other words, it relates to the very specific set of proposal reviewers – Councilors. With the Governance 2.0 introduction, the set of reviewers dramatically increased from a limited set of councilors to a much wider Dotsama community. For this reason, all the documentation needs to be adjusted so it can be better presented to the wider audience where not everyone needs to be an expert in the field to have a good understanding of the proposal content.\n\n**3. Proposal Solution**\n\nThis proposal aims to create a clear and precise framework for creating and presenting the proposals. This framework is not meant to be a strict requirement but more as a set of guidelines for the proposers to successfully present their project and increase their chance to defend the proposal and win community approval.\n\nAs the counterpart to the proposal framework, the equally important audit framework will be created as guidance for the reviewers. This audit aims to provide more precise feedback to the proposer and give a sufficient and educated review that can be later used by other voters to form their opinion on the proposal.\n\nIn a young system like this, creating these guidelines is simply not enough. To create a better treasury proposal system, a great level of engagement is required. For this reason, I propose a temporary Project manager/auditor role for a period of 3 months. The main task of the PM is to actively follow the governance tracks, objectively check and audit the proposal content according to the proposal guidelines and produce and publish the audit according to the created framework. The task of the PM is to be available to the community and gather feedback and accordingly adjust the framework.\n\n**4. Key deliverables:**\n\nProposal template – a document with predefined categories and as many pre-filled and guided data (examples) as possible.\n\nFeedback template – directly related to the proposal template. Possible checklist for each category with additional room for the feedback\n\nProduce a minimum of 30 one-page audits with included feedback on active treasury proposals or proposal discussions\n\n**5. Key objectives/ Success criteria**\n\nReduce the time required to write a detailed and comprehensive proposal – measured by the proposal owner\'s feedback\n\nHigher community involvement in the governance – measured by the number of members involved in discussions, number of provided feedback, and number of interactions with one-page reviews\n\nAll these points are taken from the full proposal document.\n\n[Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Ze8Z_f9Pa3kjALGnhu-58DNdajFQ74ONbuDeWcaFoU/edit#heading=h.5x0d5h95i329)\n\n\n\n\n'),(587,1,68,20000,6,1,34,0,'0x86ad58967a3fd9b5e281c5e0fc06ebee9a098dc10ffcc266820b509f499ad8f7',43,100,16218286,'EDVirtoiVjAv8HFZwSGbiBcY6P4kDFba9VKsBS911Aw8evX',0,1673888520,31.33,NULL,'EDVirtoiVjAv8HFZwSGbiBcY6P4kDFba9VKsBS911Aw8evX',13,16220686,NULL,NULL,NULL,8967,35992,6400,'Developer friendly stack to build Impactful Web3 Infrastructure for Kusama (funding the Virto team)','## UPDATE: Superseded by [Proposal 77](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/77)\n### Based on your feedback we won\'t be pursuing the current amount of funding, instead we will go for a \"trial run\" requesting less funds for a shorter period of time leaving out the parachain development and the hardware wallet. \n\n---\n\nHi, fellow community! Thanks for the feedback on [referendum 47](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/47), we learnt a lot and are now resubmitting our proposal to fund us The [Virto](https://virto.network) team. We are a group of creative and competent individuals with an extraordinary track record of building multiple projects in the ecosystem with funds from the treasuries and Web3 foundation. We aim to become the _\"Latin American Parity\"_ team of builders, focusing on creating user-friendly technology and tools to bring Polkadot technology to the masses.\n\nWe are proposing to build a **developer-friendly stack** to build impactful Web3 infrastructure for Kusama to empower individuals and communities through _user-friendly Web3 tools_ and **increase** decentralized technology adoption in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. The team is requesting `20,000 KSM` in funding to continue our work towards reducing social inequality and improving the efficient allocation of public resources. Our team\'s vision is to reduce social inequality and improve the efficient allocation of public resources by empowering local communities with autonomous micro-economies through our Local Incentives Protocol (LIP).\n\nGiven our previous work helping 350k+ families in Venezuela to keep their money value using crypto, we have a deep understanding of the ecosystem and, most importantly, first-hand experience building and deploying real use case solutions using web3 technology. By making it accessible to regular users, we can solve real-world problems with social impact and reduce inequality by providing a more efficient allocation of public resources.\n\nYou can check a short slideshow where we expose the problem and our proposed solution [**here**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-W13YnDHDfen7KIC0vALXbvHupEomqhg9nYUaJyxy9g/edit#slide=id.gf87435e6da_0_183), and our full proposal document [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b48eTa9GU7s0_Xf4hkyc7M1netZvNbGONJ8D_IgoknA/edit#).\n\n**Edit - Extra content:**\n- [First VirtoLIVE stream](https://youtu.be/mX3_RcKsJvQ) with team\'s intro and projects explainer\n- [VirtoLIVE Q&A #1](https://youtu.be/wk-NWqBktV4) (17/01/23): Addressing Pokassembly questions.'),(588,1,69,5,2,1,30,0,'0xe4f125ba7b0a8d8fbfba777714114095e294cb27a29b1900467d1cee55772bdc',42,10,16219103,'HL8bEp8YicBdrUmJocCAWVLKUaR2dd1y6jnD934pbre3un1',0,1673893422,31.59,1674288024,'HL8bEp8YicBdrUmJocCAWVLKUaR2dd1y6jnD934pbre3un1',0,16219113,1674288084,36.73,NULL,15634,0,11325,'Tip PolkaGate team for further testing of fast-unstake in Kusama','I was informed by Kami from PolkaGate team that they have successfully [submitted the first fast-unstake process in Kusama](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/0x58baab6ce8d74e1be1743b57d68fad11dcc1eed9ef26b892003291e33dccea18).

In the current market (last several months) validator income from the minimum commission can cover less than 50% of the server rent costs. In order to maintain a sustainable environment and prevent the network degradation I am passing this proposal to onchain voting.\n\n**Problem**\n\nThere were several topics regarding to the validator infrastructure expenses and operational costs that can be found here:\n\n[https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1980](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1980)\n\n[https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1306](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1306)\n\nA fully active validator operating at 3% commission can stand to earn:\n\n(800/1000)* 4 * 30 * 0.03 = 2.88 KSM/month. \nWith KSM priced at 34$ this equates to ~97.92 USD/month. \n\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe proposed increase of minimum commission to 10% is trying to create a better and more sustainable network environment. With the numbers given above it is clear this is a small step towards this goal. Beside the commission, we would need KSM price to double and reach 50$ in order to earn ~480 USD/month which is still within the boundaries of operational costs.\n\nWith this proposal we are not influencing KSM inflation rate. We are asking the nominators to steer 1.36% of their staking APY towards the network, current returns are 18.88% and we anticipate it to be 17.52% all other factors being equal. We need to have a strong, reliable, secure and redundant blockchain network in order to process and secure multi million $ assets on it.\n\n\n**Objectives**\n\nValidator earnings and effects on staking rewards\n\nA fully active validator operating at 3% commission can stand to earn \n(800/1000)* 4 * 30 * 0.03 = 2.88 KSM/month. : \n\n- with KSM priced at 25$ this equates to ~ 72.00 USD/month.\n\n- with KSM priced at 34$ this equates to ~ 97.92 USD/month.\n\n- with KSM priced at 50$ this equates to ~ 144.00 USD/month.\n\nA fully active validator operating at 10% commission can stand to earn \n(800/1000)* 4 * 30 * 0.1 = 9.60 KSM/ month.\n\n- with KSM priced at 25$ this equates to ~ 240.00 USD/month.\n\n- with KSM priced at 34$ this equates to ~ 326.40 USD/month.\n\n- with KSM priced at 50$ this equates to ~ 480.00 USD/month.\n\n\n**Known constraints**\n\nA significant change of KSM price can have a positive or a negative impact to the changes proposed. This proposal is not trying to set permanent staking parameters i.e.  In a scenario where KSM hits $100 anyone can start a new proposal to decrease the commission rate.\n\n\n\n**[Full Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sHrRM7wPv390GfhdPJeUKtfKD81X5ME5OIGrlDXqOXI/edit?usp=sharing)**'),(599,1,80,0,2,1,15,0,'0xc33a471f5e08871d2a0345dc0cf0a756dc1935d986800da0584c22e247d6bdc3',5,100,16375405,'GLVeryFRbg5hEKvQZcAnLvXZEXhiYaBjzSDwrXBXrfPF7wj',0,1674835350,35.63,1675135938,'EcXMStkXcWVdySF5Z3D8xq1AyAVoey6TonyN5hu1YxKt3Sz',166,16376605,1675136538,34.63,NULL,1035219,1121,1354799,'Auction now (Auction Caller) - scheduling 1 auction to replace the first missed auction meant to be scheduled by referendum 72','Auctions on Kusama are scheduled using the Scheduler Pallet. [Referendum 72](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/72) was proposed on Kusama through root Track given that the Scheduler Pallet can’t be called by the Auctions Admin (this PR will change that).

This is a continuation of the [Treasury Proposal: Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Nov-22 to Jan-23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/26).\n\nThe substrate-api-client is a Rust-library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC. It is an alternative to subxt, which provides a similar functionality. RPC clients are needed in any software component, connecting to a substrate parachain. Therefore it is advisable, that there is more than one client available for Rust developers. Apart from that, the substrate-api-client fills a gap, providing the possibility to create extrinsics in a no_std-environment. Thereby facilitating extrinsic creation from within trusted hardware (like Intel sgx). This has a big potential for further usage in IoT environments. Last but not least, the substrate-api-client has an easy-to-use interface and comes with many practical examples, which makes it a good option for new developers.\n\nThis proposal is a follow-up of the treasury proposal [maintenance for the substrate-api-client Nov22 - Jan 23](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/26).

Edgeware treasury, presented by well known crypto journalist Joon Ian Wong and produced by Pet Berisha.\n\nThe project aimed to shine a light on the advancing revolution that is ‘crypto-media’ whilst also experimenting with novel forms of public goods funding within the Edgeware ecosystem. \n\nBridging the past, present and potential future of this emerging form, the series was presented as a ‘public service podcast’ and stitched together interviews from some of the leading voices in the space:\n\n- Raoul Pal, Founder, Real Vision\n- David Bailey, CEO BTC Inc\n- Dave Nemetz, Co-Founder, Bleacher Report\n- Cammi Russo, Founder, Defiant\n- Marc Hochstein, Exec Director, Coindesk\n- Allana Roazzi-Laforet, CRO Decrypt\n- Matt Medved, Founder, NFT Now\n- Richard Welsh, Decent Partners\n- Miguel Faus, Film maker, Cadita\n- Dan Roberts, Editor-in-chief, Decrypt \n- Luc Doucet, Founder, The First Mint\n\nWe are now approaching the Kusama treasury to develop the next phase that will expand on the lessons learned in the Edgeware funded pilot project and build on the opportunity to create (network) public service media. \n\n## Problem statement\n\nWe are still very much in the early stages of the crypto revolution and media is at the centre of the battle for the narratives that will shape, define and dictate the direction of the technology.\n\nTo date, crypto-networks have been bootstrapped on the existing incentives of early, mid and late stage social media, with the digital media landscape emerging in lockstep with the vast data monopolies of Google, Amazon and Meta. As a result, existing incentives exert a kind of [narrative gravity](https://decent.partners/direction/crypto-web3-and-narrative-gravity) on the technology and those who develop it.\n\nDespite massive valuations, huge speculative bubbles and a general awareness of crypto-currencies, there are still a vanishingly small number of useful applications and users outside of those used to speculate on its future. \n\nWeb3 promises a path to releasing the stranglehold of the incumbents and yet the crypto-industry at large is still addicted to the incentives that it aims to replace, with resolutely traditional advertising strategies and brand partnerships turbo-charging speculation that has become a poor proxy for relative adoption and worth.\n\nAs a result current podcasts generally focus on the more financial aspects of the industry, since they rely on sponsorships and advertising revenue, or have an explicit marketing mandate, which ensures only positive stories are surfaced, leading to the formation of echo chambers that are rooted in repeating technical messages or announcements rather than creating original entertainment with cultural impact. \n\nThe Kusama ecosystem had just over [10,000 active addresses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h45CqUWZ2seUhbxMW6LBX4HbSxk6GouOYLyTiRQEiik/edit#gid=0) in the last 30 days. This does not mean 10,000 unique users, since power users, validators and teams will operate multiple addresses, meaning the number of contributors is likely lower. \n\nTo date, the primary marketing mechanism for driving new addresses on Kusama has been crowdloans which used direct financial incentives to onboard both venture capital and retail investors to slot auctions for new parachains. \n\nThe first Kusama slot was secured by [Karura](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/karura-wins-first-ever-parachain-slot-auction-in-kusama-polkadot-ecosystem-brings-defi-platform-62c04aaf09a1) with over 500k KSM committed. The last few crowdloaned slots have been secured with around 2k KSM representing a fall of 99% from the peak. Larger teamsare now self-funding slots, reducing the marketing function of auctions even further. \n\nOutside of crowdloans, the majority of treasury funded marketing and media spend has relied on creating and distributing content across social networks, utilising legacy metrics to assess relative progress - impressions, likes, comments, subscribers and views.\nThis approach is led by a more general notion of awareness that is hard to measure and thus difficult to price, leading to challenges with scaling the model beyond the more localised impact of core ecosystem education to already engaged holders and contributors. \n\nWith large public treasuries and its ability to develop more fluid decision making and organisational tools, Polkadot and its ecosystem offers a platform for the emergence of new talent, platforms and indeed narratives - challenging the current orthodoxy of crypto-media. \n\nPolkadot and the W3F have explicitly avoided the usual click-bait and influencer partnerships during the development of the ecosystem, however now the technology is production ready, there is a need for innovation around the way the story of the ecosystem is told, and indeed a requirement to return to the values and principles that root Web3 rather than just repeating marketing messages. \n\nThe next wave of adoption will be driven by impactful projects delivering real world value, addressing real needs and generating actual utility. The questions we seek to ask in this series:  \n\n- How will this happen? \n- Where will these projects come from? \n- What will they look like? \n- What questions will they be asking?\n- What challenges will they be addressing?\n- What value will they bring?\n- How can people contribute?\n\nUltimately, how do we reach, engage and inspire people to begin a journey of contribution rather than speculation and in turn bootstrap adoption of the underlying technology? \n\n## Introducing GMI crypto media season 1\n\nGMI crypto media is initially a podcast series, but we aim to develop it further into a core part of a crypto-native media network, all built on and around Substrate’s emerging set of tools, technologies and talent through objectively independent funding and editorial structures - moving towards a clear separation between church and state, removing direct financial incentives that conflate and confuse current initiatives that aim to present independent media.\n\nThe series will feature established and emerging faces from the community and focus on digging deep into the underlying philosophies that drew them in, providing insights and education that will be most useful to those motivated to contribute, rather than speculate. \n\nIt will also feature people from outside of the ecosystem - whose experience provides context for the challenges the technology aims to address. \n\nImportantly it will also feature those skeptical about the industry, pessimistic about its potential and even those who see issues with the current technical, economic or organisational tools, projects and mechanisms of the ecosystem. \nPart of Polkadot’s unique capability is its power to change and so we want to reflect this emergent characteristic - our hope is that these interviews can not only inspire those outside the ecosystem, but also give pause for those in it to rethink assumptions and have their ideas challenged.  \n\nIn this regard, this is explicitly not a marketing initiative - we will not be utilising paid media for distribution, nor paying for PR or influencers - it is a public service initiative, not just for the ecosystem, or potential contributors but for a broader community of academics, institutions and media outlets looking for credible, accurate and independently produced media. \n\n## Format development \n\nGMI Crypto Media will advance from the initial experiment which took the form of an audio-documentary, rather than just recorded interviews. \n\nThis is a far more creatively challenging and time consuming process that also allows for more originality when it comes to delivering a differentiated series.\n\nAlongside recorded conversations, we will include debate, archive material, musical interludes and even comedy sketches that all serve to bring to life the magic and mayhem of this rapidly emerging space - creating a must-listen series that redefines the way people interact not just with the ecosystem, but crypto in general.\n\nOur ambition is to not make an original crypto podcast, it is to make an original podcast that will appeal to a wide and varied cross-section of society.   \n\nOne reference for the direction we aim to take the podcast is the Apple commissioned series [Midnight Miracle](https://luminarypodcasts.com/listen/talib-kweli-yasiin-bey-and-dave-chappelle/the-midnight-miracle/c88501e3-f783-43cc-b00a-022d2a3ad33b?country=US) that features Dave Chapelle, Yasiin Bey and Talib Kweli. \n\nYou can get a feel for the type of material we’ve made historically by visiting our [FTTF](https://www.youtube.com/@FTTFtv) YouTube channel.\n\n## Teasers\n\nPer [Bruno\'s comment](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2158#945f8a0b-6dc0-40c8-b896-627476bfe6bd):  We are working on the format of the series - we will likely record video for some sequences and interviews but do not want to overpromise in this regard.\n\nWe will be creating short cutdowns, clips and teasers to push to the main episodes that will connect to our existing audience of 13.9K subscribers and for the talent that appear to share across their social platforms, all driving to the wallet-less onboarding where they can listen to the series for free. \n\n## Distribution and partnerships  \n\nWe expect those who feature to share the media themselves - but this will be done by them under no direction from us. \nThis approach of credibly neutral and transparently funded media can in turn allow us to deliver distribution partnerships for more objective and trusted media - especially those who are publicly accountable.\n\nThese publishers lack the kind of deep thinking, insights and access that the current ad-supported or marketing driven crypto-media landscape produces and so are desperate for content that they can trust. \n\nThis is the value of an approach that sets independence, balance and credibility above all else. \n\n## Development, schedule and communication\n\nAs with any creative endeavour within highly experimental domains things can and do change.\n\nThings that appear simple end up being complex, whilst things that should be complex come off without a hitch. More often, there are simply many surprises, dead ends and issues that cannot be accounted for within an initial pitch. \n\nAs a result the creators reserve the right to develop the format to best serve the explicit purpose of the proposal to develop a public service podcast series that aims to present balanced, critical and informative output that becomes valued by established and emerging publishers and distributors looking for high quality information sources. \n\nWe will provide updates to voters in a consistent and timely manner and alert holders if there are any critical issues. \n\n## Driving adoption of the technology \n\nIn its initial incarnation, we aim for the podcast to be accessed for free through a [wallet-less onboarding process ](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/wallet-less-onboarding-experimental-concept/458) linked to Kusama addresses, that we are collaborating with Michel and Travis from Parity on. \n\nThat onboarding is matched with [Kabocha’s](kabocha.network/) non-transferable NFT identity ‘[Seeds](https://gov.edgewa.re/discussion/6355-kabocha-seeds-outlining-the-evolving-concept-for-sovereign-identity-in-the-edgverse-and-beyond)’ providing an on-ramp into the ecosystem for those who discover the content directly or through partners. \n\nGiven the public good nature of the project and varying interview subjects, we will approach the further technological development of the project with an emergent mindset - allowing the builders we speak to and the community who listen to us to shape the emerging technical advances of the project.\n\nIn the future we aim to utilise our in development decision-making, talent sourcing and collective creation platform [Root](https://github.com/stated-tech/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/root.md). \n\nIn this way we see this more as a creative project, than a fixed podcast, one that can slowly iterate and evolve into a native on-chain network and collectives that also drives adoption of on-chain identities, assigns credit using verifiable on-chain credentials, streaming on Substrate native technologies and opening the door to all manner of experimental creative executions. \n\n## Collaborative creation \n\nWe will have a select set of people we would aim to interview from a wide range of backgrounds, but we are also open to this being a collaborative project where there is a path for the community to suggest people and indeed topics - something that we aim to expand over time as the project develops. \n\nIn time we aim for this to become a core part of the project’s development and something that will experiment with form made uniquely possible through the underlying technology. \n\n## Deliverables \n\n- Season 1: 10 episodes of 30-60 minutes \n\n- Memes, social clips, teasers, trailers and longer form interviews to be distributed across social media that drive audiences to listen to the main series.\n\n- Web app / digital site and experience that is linked to signup process.\n\n- Access to the podcast will initially be accessed through wallet-less onboarding\n\n- A subscription requiring the creation of an address and an identity. \n\n- Distribution and seeding plan and activation\n\n## Production \n\nWe will be basing production at our London community studio [Portico](https://theportico.uk) but we will also be recording interviews with guests from around the world as well as recording sequences out and about in the real world. \n\n## What does success look like? \n\nAt this early stage, we are not setting any *quantitative* metrics or KPIs but the core of the project is rooted around an experiment that will seek to demonstrate that original media can drive new and active addresses on Kusama and beyond. \n\nWe believe this will prove to be a more effective measure of the value of treasury media spend than purely legacy social media KPIs.\n\nFrom a qualitative perspective, if the project succeeds in its ambition of being a trusted source of information, valued by those inside and outside the ecosystem and indeed helps us to experiment with novel forms of onboarding into an emerging Subtrate native crypto-media network we believe that should be seen as a success.\n\nOnly in further stages of production will we begin to understand the impact this and other projects that have been incubated through fully on-chain development are having, and indeed metrics we should care about. \n\n## Potential development lifecycle   \n\n1. Edgeware pilot funding [complete]\n2. Kusama season 1 \n3. Development of a creative collective with sustained funding from Polkadot\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe will begin pre-production after funding is approved. \n\nDelivery of episodes will be dependent on availability of guests, but conservatively we’d hope to conclude the series within 6-9 months. Episodes will likely be available sooner. \n\n ## Report\n\nOn conclusion of the project, we will produce a report that charts our learnings from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective and if successful set the stage for the continuation and evolution of the project.  \n\n ## Conflicts of interest\nNone \n'),(611,1,94,0,4,1,32,0,'0x8c33c850901243e4e21bc018c20e3b5c86a003acccaf199721f64d0d309ad769',42,100,16595052,'ESJW7WgAxoybpZ6ULrh6dYwi3WpEGY2hN3wB1eYKE3NcTHo',0,1676155944,32.59,NULL,'ESJW7WgAxoybpZ6ULrh6dYwi3WpEGY2hN3wB1eYKE3NcTHo',3,16604358,NULL,NULL,NULL,6525,98882,5739,'WRONG INPUT - PLEASE REJECT | Customized Kusama Chocolate Bars','**CUSTOMIZED KUSAMA CHOCOLATE BARS** \n\n**1.General Project Information** \n\n**Short description:**  customized chocolate bars to make Kusama tangible and to give it a touch of lifestyle\n\n**Project Category / Type:** Marketing, Community events\n\n**Proponent:** Babes Papes\n\n**KSM address:** ESJW7WgAxoybpZ6ULrh6dYwi3WpEGY2hN3wB1eYKE3NcTHo \n\n**Requested allocation:** 69 KSM, $2219\n\n**Discussion date:** 11.02.2023. ​​https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2406\n\n**Onchain publish date:** 12th of February 2023\n\n**Governance referenda origin call:** small_spender\n\n**Previous treasury proposals:** n/a\n\n**Other:** n/a\n\n\n**2. Context** \n\nAfter having a short discussion about this idea with Bill at Polkadot decoded last June, he gave me confidence to try to propose this idea here at the Kusama treasury.\n\nThe motivation for this idea comes from the digital nature of blockchain making it hard to grasp in the analogue world and hence not being tangible. The logo and branding of Kusama or Polkadot should be present on daily goods to make it easier for users to connect emotionally not only visually, but for example also through flavor, sound, or touch. I believe giving Kusama or Polkadot a touch of lifestyle would be a great differentiator to other blockchains out there and in the digital world, with all its noise it’s very hard to stand out only with nice branding and logos on social media.\n\n\n**3.Problem** \n\nWhat all the blockchain projects out there have in common, is that they only market and brand themselves in the digital world, but not in the analogue real world. The attention span on social media is very short and with all the noise it’s very hard for users to connect emotionally to a blockchain project, except if they are token holders, fan boys/girls, or team members of the project.\nHow can we attract new users to Polkadot/Kusama and keep existing users connected and attracted to Polkadot/Kusama, without digital marketing methods like air drops, online quizzes, virtual meetings, NFT drops, or online ads on social media?\n\nI guess that one method which has proven itself in the last year to make users get emotionally attached to Polkadot, are real life events like Decoded or Sub0. Merchandise is also a good tool, but unfortunately it lacks creativity and by now we probably all have enough black t-shirts with a boring text logo in standard font in our wardrobe. \n\nProducing real world lifestyle products for Kusama/Polkadot should help with brand awareness and long term connectivity to new users and existing users, who value physical products that can be experienced through touch, taste, visual appearance, scent and hence motivate user to interact with Kusama/Polkadot and use the provided tools like staking, governance, minting NFTs, community growth, etc.\n\n**4.Proposal** \n\nKusama/Polkadot branded chocolate bars with custom packaging design to promote Kusama and Polkadot and other parachains with QR codes for example.

These are items of house keeping and it is best administered by the public in an open and collective manner.\n\nAs a reward, I am proposing a payout of 32 KSM (8KSM x 4) made payable to an account used by my public KSM staking rewards payout bot.

Context** \n\nAfter having a short discussion about this idea with Bill at Polkadot decoded last June, he gave me confidence to try to propose this idea here at the Kusama treasury.\n\nThe motivation for this idea comes from the digital nature of blockchain making it hard to grasp in the analogue world and hence not being tangible. The logo and branding of Kusama or Polkadot should be present on daily goods to make it easier for users to connect emotionally not only visually, but for example also through flavor, sound, or touch. I believe giving Kusama or Polkadot a touch of lifestyle would be a great differentiator to other blockchains out there and in the digital world, with all its noise it’s very hard to stand out only with nice branding and logos on social media.\n\n\n**3.Problem** \n\nWhat all the blockchain projects out there have in common, is that they only market and brand themselves in the digital world, but not in the analogue real world. The attention span on social media is very short and with all the noise it’s very hard for users to connect emotionally to a blockchain project, except if they are token holders, fan boys/girls, or team members of the project.\nHow can we attract new users to Polkadot/Kusama and keep existing users connected and attracted to Polkadot/Kusama, without digital marketing methods like air drops, online quizzes, virtual meetings, NFT drops, or online ads on social media?\n\nI guess that one method which has proven itself in the last year to make users get emotionally attached to Polkadot, are real life events like Decoded or Sub0. Merchandise is also a good tool, but unfortunately it lacks creativity and by now we probably all have enough black t-shirts with a boring text logo in standard font in our wardrobe. \n\nProducing real world lifestyle products for Kusama/Polkadot should help with brand awareness and long term connectivity to new users and existing users, who value physical products that can be experienced through touch, taste, visual appearance, scent and hence motivate user to interact with Kusama/Polkadot and use the provided tools like staking, governance, minting NFTs, community growth, etc.\n\n**4.Proposal** \n\nKusama/Polkadot branded chocolate bars with custom packaging design to promote Kusama and Polkadot and other parachains with QR codes for example.

Budget section for full details)\n\n**Discussion date**: 31 Jan 2023 (discussion)\n\n### Problem Statement\n\n- **Multi-chain, multi-account** - Most users hold and manage tokens across multiple chains, and use different accounts for custody and control (e.g. stash & controller for staking/nomination). Account holders & fund managers do not have affordable tools focused on financial management, reporting and planning.\n\n- **New processes** - Fund and Grant Management is a niche area requiring specialist attention. Managing a fund-in-a-fund is common practice, and we need a toolset to support this.\n\\\nGovernance processes are evolving fast, with new features and capabilities being added all the time. We need aggregated tracking and accounting for funds locked in validating, staking, nomination pools, lending & governance processes (proposal, bounty, childBounty).\n\n- **Lagging tools slow adoption** - Users are mostly dependent on web2 tools and spreadsheets for financial management and reporting. These tools are focused on fiat with 2-decimal computation & reporting.\n\n- **Affordability** - Existing crypto accounting tools are charging large fees.\n\n- **Parachains** - None of the existing solutions cater for parachains.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe goal of the project is to create easy-to-use tools for managing & reporting - in aggregate - across multiple chains and tokens.\n\nSubledgr would like to develop a quickbooks style accounting & reporting platform that can be tied-in with third party vendor tools for the purposes of tax calculation and compliance.\n\nSubledgr would also provide portfolio management and reporting features for working with multiple chains and accounts. We are inspired [and frustrated] by similar features from quickbooks/xero for web2 SME businesses. Following a style that is familiar to web2 users, this site will drive adoption of substrate-based tokens by making it easy to manage groups of wallets as a single fund.\n\n### Key deliverables\n\n- The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Phase 1 of Subledgr\'s roadmap includes the following features:\nReport on all transactions/extrinsics: Subledgr will provide a report on all transactions and extrinsics that have occurred on the blockchain, giving users a complete view of their cryptocurrency activities.\n\n- Categories: Transactions such as transfers between accounts, staking rewards, bond amounts, and fees will be allocated based on the user’s defined Chart of Accounts. This will help users better understand and analyse their cryptocurrency activities.\n\n- Categorisation - the basic feature that enables “bank” reconciliation and subsequent reporting \n\n- Profit & Loss: Subledgr will produce a Profit & Loss report for a specified period (e.g. week, month, year), including information on the movement of tokens earned and spent, as well as changes in exchange rates (e.g. GBP/USD).\n\n- Exchange rates: integration with an oracle for exchange rates\n\n- Export to CSV/spreadsheet: Subledgr will allow users to export their data to a CSV or spreadsheet format. This will provide a basis for any tax reporting or other financial analysis.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nA user of the system will be able to execute the following processes:\n- Login, User management & password recovery\n- Create portfolio(s)\n- Add accounts to a portfolio\n- Review all transactions for the accounts from chain / indexer\n- Allocate transactions and fees to categories\n- Report on\n  - Fund (Portfolio) Value\n- Extract transactions to CSV\n\n### Additional info\n\\\n==> see original polkassembly posting and discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2413)\n\\\n==> LINK TO FULL PROPOSAL [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15F79YMx5B5qGB3N8AlPD9r7UYW4WcH-AECFNIb6BmnA/edit#heading=h.d1jf1dgpau8)\n'),(622,1,107,6443,3,1,11,0,'0x116882450613320dbf66667a33c2826be9d210f6cdb9d6e11a3cabc03da08bf4',43,100,16747668,'G4koKt6BuioTrbHSaTqCJ5edqbQV6u39LJKcFvQNvBsszS7',0,1677073476,41.38,1678301850,'G4koKt6BuioTrbHSaTqCJ5edqbQV6u39LJKcFvQNvBsszS7',33,16748868,1678388454,32.27,NULL,98629,11566,24771,'Imbue Treasury Proposal. Freelance Marketplace','Imbue was started with the vision of accountability empowered by the blockchain. We as an ecosystem can do better!\n\nImbue at its core is milestone-based vesting powered by democracy. Proposals are submitted on the network with milestones and their respective %s. Only funders get to vote on the progress of a project since they have the most to lose, while project initiators are incentivised to continue delivering so they get more of their project’s funds unlocked.\n\nWhat we want to build is a platform where creatives, developers, researchers and anyone with talent can utilize their expertise to get paid securely and safely regardless of where they are in the world. To give people options that do not exist where they live and get funded in whatever substrate native token they wish\n\nWe believe this resonates strongly with the ethos of Kusama, and will be a great outlet to bridge over other ecosystems that can leverage Imbue and hence Kusama as a vehicle to achieve their dreams or improve their lives. Thereby pushing more adoption onto Kusama and definitively answering the popular misconception that Web3 lacks utility\n\nThe team reached out to the community and described what we wanted to do. A promise was set that - given the team\'s expertise to deliver on this - there will be no external funding until a usable product is produced. We decided to build it in an open-source manner with volunteers\n\nImbue is one of the very few(GM perhaps being the only other) that remains to this day open source and not funded with the sole purpose of protecting the community. As such, the team are also exploring ways to migrate towards a common good chain\n\nWe strongly believe that Imbue can add much-needed utility and value to Kusama beyond just DeFi, as well as help us reach beyond the Polkadot ecosystem and clearly and definitively answer \"Why Kusama?\" or \"How does this make my life better?\" and bring in users and adoption\n\nPlease feel free to look at the [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X-zlnNZ5zD9wZhNf-Prb3a5zv_HW_7aYrfcNBmPg9I4/edit?usp=sharing) and we look forward to your feedback'),(623,1,108,0,7,1,33,0,'0xb6d8dcc8df301a16b410a1bdef759fa3dbd0de076fa1e67178a2c387461e26f4',43,100,16761060,'HqRcfhH8VXMhuCk5JXe28WMgDDuW9MVDVNofe1nnTcefVZn',0,1677154014,40.97,1678282176,'J11Rp4mjz3vRb2DL51HqRGRjhuEQRyXgtuFskebXb8zMZ9s',6,16763460,1678368744,31.44,NULL,114342,5658,31300,'Establishing a bounty for Collators of System Parachains.','Dear community,\n<br/><br/>\nThis proposal seeks to fund collators of the `Statemine` network for the duration of `6 months` as a pilot.  If passed, a Collator will receive a `performance based`, fixed fiat reward of `USD$300.00` per month as well a one time `reimbursement` for work previously provided.  The proposal document was presented to current System Collators as well as Joe (W3F) and Zoltan (Encointer) to their satisfaction.\n<br/>\nAdditionally, I am taking the opportunity to test assigning a Curator to the bounty within the same proposal as approving it.  This is usually undertaken as a separate process because the bounty needs to be approved before it can be assigned a Curator.  Let\'s see how this goes, no time would be lost due to this experiment.  \n<br/>\nThe Curators are namely:\n\n- FrankyWild (`frankywild#8573`)\n- Tim Jansen (`Tim Janssen (Won\'t DM)#8682`)\n- Husni (`pastaMan#9738`)\n\nThese individuals are members of the Moderation and Anti-scam teams and also have experience with bounty curation.  They have also met the requirements as described within section 5.2 of the proposal.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n**Summary:**\n\n>A System Parachain (S.C.) is defined as any Parachain which attained its lease via governance.  This proposal aims to establish a framework for Collators on System Parachains to minimise censorship, maintain liveliness and incentivise efficient performance.  <br/>\n> \n> It attempts to achieve this by suggesting parameters for the selection, incentivisation and the ideal number of Collators on System Parachains.  It is also anticipated that this framework would form a standard that would aid future System Parachains as they are deployed. <br/>\n> \n> As a medium term solution, 1,873.69 KSM is requested to fund a bounty to incentivise Collators on the Statemine network for six (6) months.  This would be used as a pilot test and re-evaluated before further funding is provided.\n\n<br/>\n\n**Full proposal**\n\nThe full proposal can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2T1Nx90HkSAYF_CaOPLG-o3LS7h_QAa2WLDdcSJMs0/edit?usp=sharing).  \n\n<br/>\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe proposal was left for [open discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2427) for a duration of two weeks and received only one item of feedback.\n\n\n<br/><br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nWill | Paradox'),(624,1,109,6918,5,1,34,0,'0x9e67d34ba16813dfb5dbb0dd0ceb403d4b14ec23e40e3dc4722714946588dfbd',43,100,16778471,'FqM9epR4nuQ3mvkN6qVoSRMxJkuEEiSF67YEkNSt5poa7H5',0,1677258762,38.34,1678716324,'FqM9epR4nuQ3mvkN6qVoSRMxJkuEEiSF67YEkNSt5poa7H5',13,16808579,1678802910,36.07,NULL,141984,9127,40955,'POLKADOT SAFARI ~ THE HOME OF POLKADOT AND KUSAMA IN AFRICA','**POLKADOT SAFARI ~ THE HOME OF POLKADOT AND KUSAMA IN AFRICA**\n\nProponent: Polkadot Safari: GTMzNnXX1Ps663f5KhJ2ummru1hRCD9hy6yieNEZuh6G8WW\n\n**Request: 6,918.88 KSM**\n\n6,918.88 KSM (USD $289,900) (Rate: $41.845/KSM based on EMA 7 ~ Subscan on 24th Feb, 2023). \n\n\n\n\n\nGreetings,\n\nI am Sianoi Kimari, a core contributor of Safari DAO, and I am proposing a **2-day conference in Kenya, the first ever Polkadot conference in Africa.**\n\n**We are set to host attendees from the 30th March until the 1st of April**. We’re on a time crunch and have done all of the marketing organically through Twitter Spaces with teams such as Astar Network, Unique Network, Subsocial and many more.  The conference will take place in the breathtaking location of Naivasha, just 2 hours from the capital city Nairobi. Transport to and from Naivasha will be covered for attendees. With plenty options of accommodation along the same road of the venue.  This idyllic setting offers a unique barefoot networking experience, surrounded by stunning wildlife, and breathtaking scenery at the shores of Lake Naivasha.\n\nKenya has a proven track record of embracing tech innovation, and it is ranked among the top countries globally for crypto and blockchain adoption. In 2021, Kenya was ranked 5th globally for crypto adoption, and 19th in 2022.   As the home of the world’s most ubiquitous mobile payments technology, MPESA, the country\'s forward-thinking approach to technology makes it an ideal location to host a conference that promotes the benefits of Polkadot and Kusama.  **This conference will equally have a Pan-African appeal, with confirmed attendance from Polkadot Ambassadors in Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, Madagascar, and other nations**.\n\nWe aim to bring together individuals and organizations from all over Africa to learn about and explore the opportunities within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.  Polkadot and Kusama aim to provide a scalable and interoperable network that enables seamless communication between different blockchain systems. By hosting the first ever Polkadot conference in Kenya, **we hope to raise awareness of the benefits of this technology and attract new developers, community builders, and users to the ecosystem both locally and in the continent**. \n\nThe conference will bring together developers, researchers, media, investors, and other stakeholders to experience the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, share knowledge, and discover new collaboration opportunities.  **This event truly aligns with Polkadot\'s roadmap of promoting education and engagement**, and it will provide a platform for showcasing the progress that has been made towards the ultimate goal of creating a decentralized and interoperable network for a new web.\n\nThe unique setting of Naivasha will provide an unforgettable backdrop for networking and exchanging ideas, and attendees will have the opportunity to enjoy the area\'s natural beauty.  **We have nearly 200 signups for the bootckathon, 87 for speakers, 11 different parachain and ecosystem teams, and 65 local and Africa-wide scholars to be sponsored to attend the hackathon**. During writing this proposal, we have discovered parachain teams from Africa and can’t wait to meet them.\n\nYou can access our **detailed proposal** via the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5j1PTZJ7KTnfEl8nS7lkktDE3-ZG4xq3e2IUxENndA/edit) provided.\n\nFollow us on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/safaridao/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thesafaridao?s=21&t=trML2hSMjEjrMlpHYvDYcg) for updates.\n\nThank you for considering this proposal.

The deadline for submitting the proposal is 5 months from its approval.\n\nHi! I\'m Sara and for some time I decided to combine two of my passions, \"web3\" and language, to create the YouTube channel [Polkadot y Kusama - Doblaje al Español](https://www.youtube.com/@DotsamaES) with the aim that the Spanish-speaking community has access to the official content of the ecosystem Dotsama and its new technology in Spanish. I\'ve been working on the YT channel and contributing to the ecosystem since December 2021. I\'ve worked on videos like the [Polkadot Behind the Code](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Vbwe7WWl9TvtU0ECvMRAjjcG-nhAYyu) series, as well as dubbing the entire [Polkadot Decoded 2022](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Vbwe7WWl9Rwp6ZYcVI6BgzJkFXSS9dG) playlist, funded by Kusama\'s Treasury and successfully completed as you can see [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/206).\n\nDubbing of [Sub0 Polkadot Developer Conference playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOyWqupZ-WGvywLqJDsMIYdCn8QEa2ShQ) that has 24 hours of technical talks and interactive workshops to understand everything from building blockchains with Substrate to EVM and Wasm smart contracts, interoperability, trustless bridges, and building with Rust.\n\nThese videos will allow the Polkadot developer community and interested people to find out why builders are choosing Polkadot as the home of Web3.

This is in line with other recent proposals that have already been passed for other localisation projects.\nMore details about this can be found in the [Content Production](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.2vozd38qrgf4) section.\n\n2. **Implementation of a decentralised blogging platform in Polkadot** - In the spirit of Web3, the reference point of the Italian Hub will be powered by Subsocial Network and open source. We think, this part is valuable to the **entire** ecosystem, not just the Italian-speakers. This means keeping ownership of your own data and content while storing them on the blockchain with no censorship (instead of using tools like WordPress or online platforms like Medium).\nFor more details, see the [Development](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.hz4vp2rs9brz) section in our proposal. \n\n3. **Community engagement activities and events** - We will increase our presence among the most important Italian ambassadors, communities, and crypto influencers via Social Media and by organizing live shows for the Italian community. We will participate in future events in Italy and abroad.\nFor more details, refer to [Above and Beyond](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.7olosxona40s) and [Marketing and Social Media ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.fjhs79uqy1ej)sections.\n\n4. **Creation of tools for reporting and analytics** - We believe in transparency, so we will provide open reports and charts where anyone will be able to monitor the status of our activities.\nFurther details in [Reporting and Analytics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.hrxkk09upgtj) section.\n\nAll these activities and deliverables have been detailed in our costs and based on current market prices and in line with similar (and already approved) proposals.

Identity management**: Identities exist on-chain but cannot be managed via the extension, we already have shown the identity for accounts, but we want to bring the full management of identities into the extension. Accounts’ names in the extension may differ from their on-chain identities, and this may be inconvenient to distinguish which identity belongs to which name/Id. This problem will be more for users with multiple accounts. Moreover, in social account recovery, when you lose your account, most probably you cannot remember the address, hence on-chain names come in handy! By integrating the identity management into the extension, users not only can easily set their identities but also request judgements using the extension. In addition, using the on-chain identity instead of the local name of accounts, makes the accounts management more convenient. Identities also help social recovery be more user-friendly for users. \n\n**2. OpenGov**: We would like to have OpenGov features in the extension so that most token holders of the community can easily participate in new governance activities. OpenGov is new with more changes in the pipeline (v2.5). Community involvement is still low in openGov activities. Sometimes proposals are very technical, and sometimes users may not be available in the voting period to vote. Making voting more accessible and providing vote/list delegation besides all governance facilities in Polkagate extension, will increase the tokens participated in different OpenGov voting activities. \n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/polkagate/for%20stores/Governance%20V0.1%20(1).png)\n\n**3. Light client integration**: We would like to provide the Polkadot light client as an end point in the extension, which will make the extension much more standalone, and help the ecosystem to be more decentralized. If blockchain endpoints stop servicing for whatever reason, since no data can be fetched from them, hence all extensions and wallets would be useless. Integrating the light client inside the extension not only helps to distribute the Polkadot ecosystem more but also lets the extension operate while all existing endpoints stop servicing. However, we need to consider the sync waiting time when using the light client.\n\n**4. Social Recovery**: Managing your own private keys is a difficult task. The average person doesn’t want to spend multiple hours to ensure the security of their keys. This leads to people having difficulties to join the blockchain space or even worse leads to the loss of funds. Social account recovery is the solution. It allows users to recover their accounts if their key or other authentication mechanism has been lost. When an account is recoverable, if you lost the account, you can create a new account named Rescuer, and recover your lost account with the help of your lost account’s on-chain friends in a recovery process.\n\n**5. Misc. updates:** Due to adding new features in milestone 2, some new functionalities need to be added to the currently existing features, and pages need to be upgraded. With vote locking in openGov, the extension’s account page needs to be upgraded to show locks information and let account holders to clear the locks, and also show suitable alerts when locks expire. With vote delegation, we are going to let users have the option to choose un-delegation while unstaking, to have the unlocking period overlapped not stacked. To support XCM, we want to add multi chain transfering to the transfer fund page to let users teleport their tokens.\n\n\nPlease find the **full proposal** [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IOe8dNXycpu4RTmktVBeH9RAV-QW3jeUTHPxMw2rp6M/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThe discussion link on PA: [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2491)'),(638,1,125,0,7,1,33,0,'0xe91f91da9b65122f30304db4b139ee54af3fe3b9a4a10a5ee33abf5e771e5be0',37,100,17019858,'HqRcfhH8VXMhuCk5JXe28WMgDDuW9MVDVNofe1nnTcefVZn',0,1678711134,31.45,1679792850,'J11Rp4mjz3vRb2DL51HqRGRjhuEQRyXgtuFskebXb8zMZ9s',6,17022258,1679880042,33.33,NULL,135730,1994,41118,'Assigning Curators for Bounty 20 (System Parachain Collators)','Dear Community,\n\nWith the passing of [referendum 108](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/108), we would like to take the next step of assigning a Curator.

However, integrating on-ramp services can be challenging for parachains due to high costs and extensive liquidity requirements. Meanwhile, in order to integrate parachain tokens, service providers face barriers such as limited token volume and restricted exposure to DeFi solutions.\n\nAfter conducting extensive research and interviews with various on-and-off-ramp service providers, along with numerous conversations with different projects in the ecosystem, we decided to work with [Banxa](https://banxa.com/), a leading payment service provider, to bring to you a bounty program that aims to provide an affordable on-ramp service tailored for Polkadot and Kusama assets.\n\nThis bounty program is intended to help as many parachains as possible in establishing easy and secure solutions for native token on-ramp, thereby improving the user acquisition process for the ecosystem as a whole.

As with the previous (cancelled) referenda, this includes the upgrade to XCM v3. This proposal is a bit dense, so will break it down. It\'s a `force_batch`, meaning that even if one of the calls fails, it will still execute the later ones.\n\nThe first two calls are `xcm.send` extrinsics that send `authorize_upgrade` messages to Statemine and the BridgeHub.\n\nThe next two schedule calls on the Relay Chain to set the XCM version it uses to communicate with Statemine and the BridgeHub to `3`. They are scheduled for 600 blocks (1 hour) later because that is the upgrade delay imposed on parachains. So it should update to 3 at about the same time that the parachains upgrade.

But a key different between \"Substrate in Bits\" and these solutions is that the technical content in “Substrate in Bits” are not designed to be specific courses. Instead, they’re designed to address specific issues often faced by developers. \n\nA key component of addressing these issues and creating technical content, is consulting with experts and getting their opinion (this is a core component of our research process). \n\n[Jump to available solutions section of the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.o7vbzgqhvmxu)\n\n\n\n<br>**Proposed solution**</br>\nThis proposal aims to tackle the existing problems by:\n- Creating technical content using a problem-based approach. The goal of these “Substrate in Bits” is to address common issues faced by substrate developers and go in-depth on why these problems arise and how to solve/avoid them. \n- Making technical content as collaborative as possible, allowing engineers from the community to make contributions and make Substrate in Bits an up-to-date and trusted reference for substrate developers. In order to achieve this, all our technical content will be housed on GitHub. This will make it easy for interested contributors to contribute to improving these pieces of content in the future.\n\nBy compiling these information in one easily accessible location, developers can more quickly and effectively troubleshoot their code and gain a deeper understanding of Substrate\'s technical components.\n\nThis will not only save developers time and effort but making the content open-source on Github contribute to the growth and success of the Substrate ecosystem by encouraging greater participation and collaboration.\n\n[Jump to the Proposed solution section of the Proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.4zgqeocu4ug5)\n\n\n\n<br>**Scope of work and Deliverables**</br>\nThe key deliverable for this proposal is 40 pieces of \"Substrate in Bits\" content.

These public projects enable the parachain teams and teams within their ecosystem to increase the data indexing speed of their SubQuery projects by up to 10 times.\n\n**Raw Data:** <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17829KgXp5aXKXkaPw7A7oCgjMBB8vEuCg2Pyk1MGQnY/edit#gid=0>\n\n**Full Proposal:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOriginal Motivation\n===================================\n\nSubQuery is the universal data indexing toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Kusama, and other layer-1 chains in Substrate, Avalanche, Algorand, Terra, NEAR, and Cosmos projects, we provide data for developers to use for a wide array of projects (wallets, explorers, custom chains, or any other decentralised app). In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.\n\nThroughout the whole of 2022 (01/01/2022 - 31/12/2022) we\'ve provided public SubQuery Projects, termed Dictionaries, for most parachains in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem to dramatically increase indexing performance (up to 10x faster) and so far these dictionaries have served over 1 billion requests.\n\nA SubQuery dictionary is a special SubQuery Project which scans over the network, and records metadata of every event and extrinsic on each block. When other SubQuery projects index data on any of these chains, they can ask the dictionary what blocks a filtered list of events/intrinsics appear on. Rather than having to search through each block, dictionaries reduce the amount of data that the indexer obtains from the chain, reduces load on free RPC endpoints across the ecosystem, and reduces the number of \"unwanted\" blocks stored in the local buffer. For example, instead of SubQuery inspecting each block of Polkadot\'s massive chain (600GB of unstructured data on over 12 million blocks) which can take many hours, dictionaries skip through to the exact right blocks.\n\nAdding the dictionary  to optimise indexing performance is as easy as adding the relevant network dictionary endpoint to your SubQuery Project. This has been added by default to all of our starter projects to make it default to use.\n\nHere you can find detailed documentation on how dictionaries work: <https://academy.subquery.network/academy/tutorials_examples/dictionary.html#>\n\nSubQuery Dictionaries have been created for most parachains to the public here <https://github.com/subquery/subql-dictionary> and have been deployed to our Managed Service. If any other team would like a dictionary created - we are more than happy to help out.\n\nFuture Targets for Our Dictionaries\n===================================\n\n-   We\'re proud of our record on stability and reliability. One of our core values is to be blockchain\'s most reliable indexer, and we don\'t intend to lose sight of this as we onboard more chains and expand the number of customers relying on our hosted service for their production applications. Our goal for 2023 is 99.99% uptime, we\'re starting off strong with 100% so far as seen [here](https://status.subquery.network/uptime/f3j5qtmn4rhd).\n\n-   Through 2022 we ran 24 dictionaries for the in-demand parachains that we believed would add most value to the dApp developers in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. Moving forward we want to be able to offer the increased indexing performance to all active block-producing parachains, our goal will be to add 20 more dictionaries to our suite of tools in 2023.\n\n-   Being on the cusp of 1 billion requests to our dictionaries in 2022 has left us hungry to smash records in 2023. This year, with the launch of our decentralised SubQuery Network and ongoing Business Development efforts, we are looking to hit (and surpass) a target of 10 billion requests to our dictionaries.\n\nGithub Contributors. Our [dictionaries are completely open source](https://github.com/subquery/subql-dictionary), and SubQuery is a community project with a goal of complete decentralisation. Already last year, we welcomed contributions to our dictionaries from developers at Nodle and Subscan. We are working on making it easier for new parachains to assist us with creating dictionaries.\n\n--\n\n**Full Proposal Found Here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing)'),(649,1,138,3404,6,1,34,0,'0x36ea5e81a0c4f5b6a446bf6cba174a213eac8561c146e1b04a4662a23cf217bb',43,5,17163132,'GWp4e6czcwtq54WavFVrFzPtQ8NCVde6V7L6q5byau66yd6',0,1679571894,33.95,1680843156,'GWp4e6czcwtq54WavFVrFzPtQ8NCVde6V7L6q5byau66yd6',13,17165532,1680929982,32.61,NULL,79776,20690,42658,'OpenBrush 8-9, 11-12 milestones development (WASM smart contracts)','Dear Kusama Community,\n\nWe would like to share the proposal for the development of 8-9 and 11-12 milestones of [OpenBrush](https://openbrush.io/)\n\n\nYou can check initial discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2522).\n\nThe price was calculated by EMA7 rate on the date of proposal submission, so the calculations were the following:\n235200 / 2 / 34.541 = 3404.64954692 KSM\n\n### TL;DR\nThe purpose of this proposal is to grow the emerging **WASM smart contracts field**, by developing core infrastructure product **OpenBrush**.  \nAs Gavin mentioned in this [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/25/polkadots-gavin-wood-webassembly-is-the-future-of-smart-contracts-but-legacy-evm-is-right-now/) article, WebAssembly is the future of smart contracts. Also, as was mentioned in the approved [WASM smart contracts bounty](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1491) currently smart contracts parachains lead the ecosystem in terms of market adoption. \nHowever, despite WASM tech having a lot to offer, it\'s not being widely used at the moment simply because of lack of proper tooling and ecosystem infrastructure products\n\n**OpenBrush** is a core infrastructure product, a starting point, and a base for every ink! dApp. 12 production-grade teams and 3 parachains currently use OpenBrush. This proposal is a continuation of the development of the successful product, proposing the most developer-needed features, validated by market feedback.   \n\n### Context\n\nRight now Polkadot ecosystem has a lack of Polkadot native dApps as most of them running are just forks of already existing things on Ethereum network. We already have such unique features as XCMP and WASM smart contracts, but the entrance threshold is too high since there are not much tools to help newcomers use them.\n\nOur team at [Brushfam](https://brushfam.io/) is committed to creating a developer-friendly ecosystem for ink! smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem. Based on the data we believe that our products, including [OpenBrush](https://github.com/727-Ventures/openbrush-contracts), [Sol2Ink](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink), and [Typechain-Polkadot](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot), have become the starting point for every smart contract developer entering the ecosystem.\n\n### Proposal\nWe would like to share our proposal for the development of 8-9 and 11-12 milestones of [OpenBrush](https://openbrush.io/)(10th milestone was implemented in [separate grant ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OySc-dNTBWTF768GOLiPgh4plE1kkO2wI37z-hXvy78/edit)and covered by AlephZero). OpenBrush is a base library for ink! smart contracts. It provides standard contracts (based on PSP), as well as useful contract implementations and macros to help you build ink! smart contracts. \n\n### Roadmap\nWe talked with smart contracts parachains (Astar, AlephZero, Phala) and companies using OpenBrush and have prepared following roadmap for the next milestones of OpenBrush: \n- Creation of educational materials for ink! smart contract developers, designed for both newcomers and advanced developers.\n- Establishment of new standards for smart contracts in Polkadot, with a focus on new NFT standard, and implementation of these standards as part of OpenBrush.\n- Adoption of a chain extension approach in our work.\n- Contribution to the development of ink! smart contract language.\n- Introduction of new features to make OpenBrush more flexible.\n\nWe are committed to achieving these objectives and believe that they will help drive the growth and adoption of ink! smart contracts in Polkadot.\n\n### Full Proposal\nFor more information on our proposal, including a detailed roadmap, please see the following link:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b49juyKJN0W-UBHoJ4iS3P_I0Z5a94YoNLxylIf-As8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b49juyKJN0W-UBHoJ4iS3P_I0Z5a94YoNLxylIf-As8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThank you for your consideration, and we look forward to your support!'),(650,1,139,5,6,1,32,0,'0x82e631404d5fef4027bb0b3978f3cf2b37d88756aefbd7ba0b704f63b80c2324',87,100,17178699,'H1tAQMm3eizGcmpAhL9aA9gR844kZpQfkU7pkmMiLx9jSzE',0,1679665734,33.67,1680569556,'H1tAQMm3eizGcmpAhL9aA9gR844kZpQfkU7pkmMiLx9jSzE',3,17181099,1680656556,34.15,NULL,72661,1876,43270,'Resubmission of previous proposal [BigTipper #7]','Hey everyone,\n\nAs a follow up today I would like to resubmit the [BigTipper #7](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/7) previously approved by the community.\n\nThis Tip proposal [BigTipper #7](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/7) was submitted for MathCrypto by me, related to his work on the batch delegate [webpage](https://backend-opengov.math-crypto.com).

The project aims to address the limited number of WASM developers in the Web3 and Polkadot/Kusama community, showcase the capabilities of WASM smart contracts, and inspire developers to explore the untapped potential of 100% on-chain games.\n\nOver the course of three months, Impulse DAO will fund and support five teams to build fully-functioning dApps, featuring WASM smart contracts, front-end, and design.

By creating a gamified learning environment, these games can attract more developers to the Kusama ecosystem, showcasing the advantages of WASM smart contracts compared to EVM, and ultimately contribute to the growth of the developer community.

We are Nachito (Polkadot Senior Ambassador) and Roco (Polkadot  Ambassador). We have created a brand for the Spanish speaking community named [**DOTCAST**](https://linktr.ee/dotcast_), which started seven months ago as a weekly podcast on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3I8Ec-2pECzR_Y6lApwogA), based on the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem.\n It\'s not just an opinion podcast, we interview developers, founders and ecosystem members on the current topics of Kusama and Polkadot. We are also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dotcast_), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/68chK6sM4HYBPJlxSnSEBP?si=fc97e68479174e64&utm_medium=share&utm_source=linktree&nd=1) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@Dotcast_) as well. Constantly posting relevant info about the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem, aiming to “spread the word” in a friendly and understandable way for everyone.\n\nThis partnership began a year ago, translating from English to Spanish all the content that we considered important for the community. Like the rabbit-hole syndrome that we are sure many of you have experienced, we went from translating documents and ended up dubbing Polkadot videos for the community. \n\nIt\'s important to mention that we never discuss subjects related to price or financial speculation.\n\n**General Goals**\n\n- Create content that brings real value to our community.\n- Generate true and honest awareness.\n- Achieving growth in the Spanish-speaking communities around Polkadot.\n- Inspire others to get involved.\n- Show the community what and how the future is being built.\n\nOur development so far was covered by Wag Media, but we are looking to continue the work with a spending proposal.\n\n\n**Specific Proposal Goals**\n\n- Brand development for DOTCAST (Website creation, development and SEO on social media), seeking to increase visibility and followers.\n- Attend at least three Polkadot related events in 2023 (air tickets and hotel) creating original content within the event and increasing visibility with the focus on the Spanish speaking community.\n- To be able to pay for last year\'s re-branding and graphics to our designer.\n- Achieve stability to the team through funding and constant quality improvement on the product.\n\n**Problem statement**\n\n- Polkadot can be complex for its users, not to mention newcomers.\n\n- People need to be supplied with reliable and user-friendly information.\n \n- Lack of original and good quality content in native language that improves over time.   \n\n- Participation in governance should be encouraged.\n\n- Understand technical updates that are published.\n\n- There is a huge increase in the amount of information generated.\n\n- There is a large gap between the core ecosystem with its constituent members and people.\n\n**Solution**\n\nAs it was mentioned before, our goal is to continue creating original content for the Spanish speaking community aiming to raise awareness of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem with the focus on the way this technology is being built and which are the use cases for it.\n\n The general idea is to communicate in a friendly way so the potential users could feel in a peer to peer environment, as well as the users who already have a certain level of knowledge and would like to keep updated with quality information every week.\n\n We believe that Governance 2.0 is a key factor related to adoption and participation as well, with that being said we already dedicate a portion of the podcast to this topic to encourage people in this subject.\n\n The compiled information that we provide helps the community to stay updated in a trustless way, with the possibility to interact through comments, exchange opinions and generate feedback. \n\nAll of this is supported by interviews with developers from Parity and some of the parachains as well, and as you can check it for yourself, the community topic is always within our questions. Dotcast was born from the community and for the community, providing  a space for ecosystem projects to connect with people. \n\n**How does this proposal differ from other content creation initiatives?**\n\nThis proposal, in addition to creating original content in the native language, seeks to empower the community by binding their voices and encouraging them to participate in governance as a unit. With this union we also bring to spotlight the specific problems of our society looking for use cases within the ecosystem that can provide real solutions to users who need to be heard.  \n\nNowadays, the community is made up of dispersed groups that from time to time bind together to carry out a particular event. Dotcast believes that this union can be permanent, flexible and dynamic in order to achieve a clear message to the community users and accomplish important things by demonstrating its strength in the governance process. \n\nFinally, we are unaware of the existence of a native project born within the community, which has been under development for 7 months and has gone through two Bounties. Lucky enough to interview the founders of Polkadot and current developers, among other personalities, to then seek funding from the treasury with the same goals set out in this proposal.\n\n**Why not fund the project through a Bounty?**\n\n- The project has already participated in Wag Media\'s Bounty #12 and Creadores Web 3, it has managed to progress up to this level. Going back to a Bounty would be walking backwards in terms of natural evolution. \n\n- This project is about continuing to build a brand related to Polkadot & Kusama in Spanish, it is not just about content videos looking for a previously determined economic reward.\n\n- Not depend on others and continue to build our own reputation.\n\n- To have secured funds for a period of 6 months and a work schedule. The Bounty´s bags are usually out of stock before they are planned, due to the great demand and generation of content that they produce.\n\n- The content bounties were created precisely to incentivize and guide creators in their first steps within the ecosystem, therefore we believe that our product is not a good fit for them. It would be taking funds away from other potential creators in their first level of development.\n\n\n\nFull Proposal **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xn8HvhyrBG0ktO433fp8LNvn7Xp5dyOH/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115896797857518580767&rtpof=true&sd=true)**.\n'),(658,1,150,843,4,1,33,0,'0x5dc0dde46f7beb00cc24c5c4e10786730b59f4830ba8a86c4688c9e27ae147ca',43,100,17382129,'GkMByX2YdJa8USs4NJLzqYnzB2mTLotCuHWhs4bF9Ht5eio',0,1680894810,32.50,1681910118,'GkMByX2YdJa8USs4NJLzqYnzB2mTLotCuHWhs4bF9Ht5eio',6,17384529,1681996890,34.22,NULL,71998,11424,57842,'Kusama — From Theory to Practice Course','**Context**\n\nWe are a team of academic specialists from [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/) (which has a [parachain of the same name](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/explorer) on Kusama) led by Professor Alexander Kapitonov, one of the founders of the project.\nWe have set a goal to create comprehensive and illustrative educational materials for a wide audience with zero or initial knowledge of web3 technologies.\n\nAn explanation of our goals and lecture speech sample is also available on YouTube:\nhttps://youtu.be/WlGDvLHmbqE\n\n**Problem**\n\nResearch has shown that the existing courses dedicated to cryptocurrencies and web3, despite their sufficient elaboration, concentrate either on the financial component or are intended exclusively for developers.

Through the discussion with fellow community members, the idea grew and evolved into the project you see in front of you, intended as a comprehensive ecosystem discovery: to connect all the ecosystem actors, from big to small. \n\nThe Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem is not only about parachains and relay chains; it’s also about pallets, wallets, apps and Dapps, browser extensions, utility libraries, websites, etc. In one word this ecosystem is about community. Without good project discoverability, the community cannot find the information it needs.\n\nOur aim is to make project discoverability seamless and simple. This way, everyone can access the information they need to contribute to the ecosystem\'s growth.\n\n## Retroactive payment for PoC development\n\nThis proposal is for **a retroactive payment** by Kusama Treasury to **reimburse for 60%** of the development costs for the work on Polkadot Discovery Portal PoC, [see the scope here](https://www.notion.so/kelp/Retroactive-Funding-for-Polkadot-Chain-Pallet-Discovery-09c9c9adc77e4f22b7c7b36494f991c5?pvs=4#4bcaaa1790d4481e9c9ba74f04ddeaea)\n\nIf this initiative gets initial support, as the next steps, based on the community feedback received so far, we are planning to prioritize the following: \n\n- coordinated projects onboarding, ambassadors engagement & incentives\n- implementing a minimalistic UI to allow for alternative forms of submissions\n- integrations with other platforms & channels\n\n## Key differentiators of Polkadot Directory Portal \n\n**All for chain discovery on Polkadot & Kusama:**\n\n- detailed descriptions & tags\n- runtime versions, genesis hashes\n- spec files for easy referencing\n\nUp-to-date and readily accessible information on the stage of each chain and the paraID and relay connection details for parachains.\n\n**Data updates & verification**\n\n- Any user can independently verify the info & contribute to improving the dataset by opening a pull request: [https://polkadot-discovery.macula.link/how-to/](https://polkadot-discovery.macula.link/how-to/)\n- To ensure the integrity of the data, we\'ll require a public display of approval from a member of the respective project (GitHub organization) before merging the PR.\n- See [Chart 1: Adding & Updating data](https://www.notion.so/kelp/Retroactive-Funding-for-Polkadot-Chain-Pallet-Discovery-09c9c9adc77e4f22b7c7b36494f991c5#ebc5785874ec4cdaaa7948e33ddab5e2) for details\n\n**Data Sources: \"Unused data is useless.

The first proposal, Milestone 0, addressed OpenGov issues by developing a proposal and audit templates, initiating community discussions, and creating audit reports. The second proposal, Milestone 0.5, expanded the initial project by introducing the program to onboard additional proposal Auditors to enhance the decentralization and accuracy of score results.\n\nIn the previous period, we successfully completed a total of 54 audits, of which 19 were conducted by auditor candidates. One of the candidates, [Abdulbee](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/165) successfully completed the full auditor onboarding process being approved by Kusama community via an on-chain OpenGov tip.\n\n**Problem**\n\nAn additional challenge in the current proposal evaluation process is the lack of constructive feedback during the discussion phase. To address this, appointed auditors will shift their focus by becoming more involved in the earlier phases of proposal development. This proactive approach will help proposers receive feedback and address potential weaknesses in their proposals before they are submitted onchain, giving them time to evaluate the feedback and make improvements.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nIn **Milestone 1**, the primary objective is to continue onchain proposal audits, further expand Auditor tasks, continue collaboration with Polkassembly and introduce Auditor and Reviewer roles.\n\nTo ensure transparency and community involvement, our main goal is to transfer the Audit process to the Kusama community. This will be achieved by moving the Audit report work to the **post-paid OpenGov Tips,** where approved auditors will be compensated for their efforts. This approach ensures fairness and accountability in the process while keeping it open to the community.\n\nIn this proposal, we present the continuation of the Audit team work, with the aim to deliver Audit Reports for 60 treasury proposals over a period of 2 months. Our goal is to ensure that these proposals receive the evaluation and feedback they deserve. All work will be post-paid through self-submitted tips, with auditors initiating self-tips for their completed proposal audits. To avoid overloading the treasury track, a tip must cover compensation for a minimum of 5 audit reports.\n\nTo effectively evaluate project proposals using the Audit Template, it is essential to have an objective and standardized grading system in place.

As Gavin mentioned in this [CoinDesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/25/polkadots-gavin-wood-webassembly-is-the-future-of-smart-contracts-but-legacy-evm-is-right-now/), WebAssembly is the future of smart contracts. However, we assume that businesses and developers hesitate to move their products to the Substrate/ink! smart contracts ecosystem because the resources and onboarding time needed for such a transition are just high compared to the potential reward. Sol2Ink decreases the time needed for such a transition rapidly. A transition that could have taken a few months may take a week. \n\nSol2Ink is our infrastructure product, which transpiles Solidity smart contracts to ink! smart contracts and can be used for businesses to help them with the transition as well as can help seasoned Solidity developers decrease the learning curve of ink! rapidly. This proposal is a continuation of the development of the product while also aiming to expand the ink! market to existing Solidity/EVM markets.\n\n### Context\nBased on the data, it seems that the Polkadot ecosystem is not fully attractive for existing projects from other ecosystems like Ethereum, Polygon, or other EVM chains. Even though these projects can be massively enhanced by all the features and possibilities available with Polkadot, Substrate, Rust, ink!, and WASM, there is little incentivization to migrate. They have their product working already, large liquidity and user base available, and onboarding to Rust and ink! can be difficult and resource-demanding. We also see that the onboarding layer for Solidity developers is rather high, which is caused by the difference in difficulty between Solidity and Rust programming languages.\n\nOur team at Brushfam is committed to creating a developer-friendly ecosystem for ink! smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem. Based on the data, we believe that our products, including OpenBrush, Sol2Ink, and Typechain-Polkadot, have become the starting point for every smart contract developer entering the ecosystem. Sol2Ink specifically aims to lower this entrance threshold by allowing seasoned Solidity developers to easily migrate from Solidity to more complicated Rust and ink!, while also serving the purpose of a learning tool to lower the learning curve.\n\n### Proposal\nWe would like to share our proposal for developing of milestones 3 & 4 of Sol2Ink. Sol2Ink is an infrastructure product used for an easy transition from Solidity to ink!. It aims to lower the entry barrier for businesses to transit from Solidity/EVM to ink!, and to lower the learning curve of ink! for seasoned Solidity developers.\n\n### Roadmap\n\nOur roadmap is divided into two parts:\n\n1. Market research and tutorial for Sol2Ink for introduction to the product - our goal is to research the interest for such a product between the Solidity / EVM stakeholders, which will also raise the awareness of the possibility of such an easy transition to a new promising ecosystem. We will also showcase how easy it is to create a full-stack ink! app in a video tutorial, just by providing the original Solidity code base.\n\n2. Upgrade of Sol2Ink focused on the output of fully compilable contracts - currently Sol2Ink can transpile most Solidity code bases in one click, but there is still a need for a developer to check the outcomes since it is a program producing code. Our long-term goal is for Sol2Ink to produce code, where the minimal interference of a developer with the produced code is needed to have a fully ready 1:1 application. The fourth milestone of Sol2Ink is the first step to achieving this goal.\n\n### Full Proposal\nFor more information on our proposal, including a detailed roadmap, please see the following link:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iTUZ7CeBTaPV-141EfJUjiISAniuK0dvNdeVhW-Bks/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iTUZ7CeBTaPV-141EfJUjiISAniuK0dvNdeVhW-Bks/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1)\n\n\n\n**Great comment from public discussion.

While we have basic functionality, we still need to develop more features to reach current ecosystem state and its functionality. Also, we agreed to collaborate with a couple of projects in ecosystem to develop base SDKs for their services in Swift and Kotlin, and chose extra providers to develop SDKs for, which cover most popular functionality in mobile applications. Furthermore, we now seek to make our Kotlin libraries be written fully in Kotlin and use only Kotlin libraries so that we can make our libraries ready for Kotlin Multi Platform.\n\nWe initially tried to propose bigger amount of functionality to faster reach current state of ecosystem, but even though we received many approvals, our [proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/351) haven\'t reached its majority. So after gathering feedback from the community and the council, we decided to decrease our scope to minimum required functionality to support all parachains and make our libraries available in all major dependency managers as long as with being ready for Kotlin Multi Platform development, also we lowered our hourly rate in order to match current market. Also, since our libraries still do not have major users we\'re going to participate in as many as possible public and online events to spread the word. \n\n**What we\'re trying to accomplish within this milestone**\n\nMost of our efforts are projected to be put into Substrate client we made for Swift and Kotlin.\n\nPrimary purpose is to create pre-created set of models and functionality like popular and common between all networks constants, storage queries, functions and events, so end developer will not need to always write boilerplate code. This potentially saves thousands of hours if we take into consideration multiple teams working with these libraries. Also we want to boost our extrinsic service to have all day-to-day methods in it: fees estimation, transfers, batch requests, and so on.\n\nSecondly, we want to develop special manager which will be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous clients at the same time. Mobile devices even though they\'re powerful nowadays still not almighty. Application sandbox is limited, thus in order to work with many networks in parallel we wish to create set of functions and classes which will be responsible for turning on and off all clients depending on current app function optimizing CPU and RAM usage.\n\nTo make this manager it\'s also needed to have some caching mechanism: we propose to create a database which will be responsible for storing everything from these multiple connections, work with pre-defined common constants, storage queries, functions, and events, combining everything together to speed up and optimize cold and hot starts of Substrate client instances.\n\nLast but not least part of Substrate client improvements in this milestone is to provide support to work with all existing parachains. Every network has their own runtime which sometime differs very much. So we look forward to create as many as possible unit tests to check compatibility of our Substrate client with every existing parachain today. Indeed this would require a lot of internal client changes. So we will do our best to keep our codebase clean and tidy, and at the same time powerful to handle dozens of different networks, and hundreds of connections.\n\nAlso, in this proposal we\'re looking forward to making a set of small libraries to provide SDK interface to most popular block explorers which are used for fetching history and many more: SubQuery, Subsquid and Subscan. For now, we decided to develop basic interface so that we don\'t dive too deep into all functionality and get burden of supporting it all. In this proposal we want to provide functionality that allows developers to use all of the service features, but maybe with small tweaks. However, we might find some solutions to do later to optimize and avoid this extra customization. As extra, there will be couple of token/fiat exchange rate resolvers to choose from.\n\nIn parallel, there are two small projects. Provide Combine interface in our Swift libraries so that Swift developers can choose what asynchronous approach they would like to use in their application. And Kotlinization. This is very special project for us: we have created a few of libraries in Kotlin from scratch like schnorrkel algorithm. And since we still rely on some Java libraries, it is not that easy to make our Kotlin libraries compatible with Kotlin Multi Platform. This technology opens a big opportunity to use our libraries in many different platforms from mobile applications to web, so we\'re encouraged to make our libraries ready for this bright future.\n\n**Our mission**\n\nWe want the Substrate ecosystem developers to just do brand new features to make the ecosystem richer and be recognizable by even more people around the globe, while we can hold their backs by doing a great infrastructural work. We want to see more mobile apps in the ecosystem either from existing parachains to launch their own apps or absolutely new mobile wallets with more innovative functions. Same we want to help existing applications by solving their core issues within our works and help them adopt our products. Also we aim to partner with as much as possible existing networks and/or companies who already deliver their services to ecosystem, so that even their products might be easy accessible via reliable SDKs.\n\n**Proposal financing and deliverables**\n\nWe\'re requesting $79,200 for the current milestone which includes improvements to existing Substrate clients, supporting all parachains with demo applications showing functionality, adding Combine interface to Swift libraries, adding Swift libraries as Swift Package Manager packages, and migrating our Kotlin libraries to use only Kotlin, not Java dependencies. Each part is planned to be released separately and sequentially along with publications to public package managers\' repositories, as well as on our GitHub for a review. Also we\'re planning announcements on our Telegram channel and future Medium blog with a brief description of deliverables. And in the end when we finish documentation part we\'re going to publish on-chain report with appropriate links to the open source code, package managers\' repositories, our articles on Medium, and links to documentation website ([https://docs.sublab.dev](https://docs.sublab.dev))\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you any constructive feedback and/or questions regarding our planned works.

More information about Web3group can be found on its official [website](https://web3-g.com/web3hackathon2023/).\n\nIn 2022, Web3 Group and Gear joined forces to create the first Web3 University Hackathon in Mexico, with a focus on teaching and training future engineers about the stack that Gear shares with Polkadot. The event concluded with a successful hackathon where many dapps were created using the Gear Protocol. This hackathon was combined with a conference to which the general public was invited to listen to well-known speakers in Mexico. The event had 100 students coding and about 300 visitors.\n\nIf you want to see the pictures of the previous event please check this [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-3lE-BApXr8wa5pwD-pYPtE60qWWdZlimn2XVwujARw/edit)\n\nCointelegraph served as our media sponsor and covered the event in their [press release](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/gear-partners-with-the-biggest-mexican-universities-to-bring-first-web3-universities-hackathon), published in both English and Spanish.\n\nAfter our successful first event with the top universities in Mexico, we received positive feedback confirming that there is a lot of talent but a lack of education about the blockchain ecosystem, especially regarding the cutting-edge Polkadot technology.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that our upcoming event will be bigger and better than ever before. We will welcome 300 students and open up the conference events to 600 visitors. Additionally, we would like to invite more parachains to join our exciting hackathon. We are delighted to have the support of the Gear Foundation for this event and would like to extend an invitation to partner with us to spread the word about DotSama and its potential to the next generation of developers and students. Let\'s work together to create a vibrant ecosystem that will continue to evolve and innovate.\n\n### 2.- Problem statement\n\nAccording to a Chainalysis study. LATAM is the market with the biggest growth in the world on the blockchain ecosystem and the second one with more transactions in 2022. \n\nDespite the significant adoption of blockchain in LATAM, Polkadot/Kusama and its parachains are not yet positioned at the forefront, and there is still room for the development of new decentralized applications within the ecosystem. The adoption of technologies that facilitate an easy transition from web2 to web3 development presents a vast potential for new developers. WASM is a key feature of this adoption, and both Kusama/Polkadot and Gear Protocol share this pillar, utilizing programming languages like Rust to create real potential for growth. However, education is necessary to achieve this goal.\n\nWe really aim to introduce Kusama and Polkadot to the general public in Mexico and students at the country\'s top universities. These students represent the future developers and adopters of this technology. By exposing them to Rust programming and providing opportunities to develop applications on different parachains, we aim to deeply engage them with the ecosystem. Our goal is to spark interest and generate excitement, and who knows, they may even create the next highly popular app.\n\n### 3.- The proposed solution\n\nWeb3group and Gear Foundation have joined forces to create educational events, including bootcamps, aimed at teaching the tools required to create decentralized applications using Rust compiled to WASM. The culmination of this educational effort will be a Mega Bootcamp, held in conjunction with some of the best computer science universities in Mexico. The event will span the entire country, with more than 30 universities in 5 different locations spreading the word about the Polkadot ecosystem, Substrate, and parachains. The event will culminate in a Mega Hackathon to be held in Mexico City.\n\n**3.1 - How does this proposal help the Dotsama ecosystem?**\n\nTo address this challenge, we propose organizing four regional hackathons aimed at educating students about Kusama and Polkadot. The winners of these hackathons will then be invited to participate in the main hackathon, where they will engage in a three-day coding challenge, receive mentorship, and have the opportunity to build connections within the community. Through this process, participants will gain a deep understanding of the Web3 world and the DotSama ecosystem. This hands-on approach will not only introduce them to the technology but also inspire them to become future developers and adopters of this emerging field.\n\n`Goals`\n\n- Enhance awareness and comprehension of the DotSama Ecosystem and its Parachains.\n- Build a community of skilled developers capable of building cutting-edge technology for the Polkadot ecosystem.\n- Create new minimum viable products (MVPs) for all participating Parachains using decentralized applications.\n\n`Metrics`\n\n- Reach the whole country by doing face-to-face events in 5 main cities. \n- Join the best 30+ universities in Mexico to educate about the technology behind Polkadot/Kusama, parachains and Gear Protocol.\n- Touching 1000+ future engineers to prepare them to use technologies related to the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. \n\nThe proposed initiative aims to benefit the DotSama ecosystem and its parachains, with a focus not only on the community but also on the generation of new future developers. Additionally, a follow-up with continuous educational events is planned to ensure sustained growth and development.\n\nTo accomplish this, we have also partnered with [Zona3](https://twitter.com/lazonatres), an educational institution that will provide Rust programming education to students before they participate in the hackathon. This partnership aims to attract more qualified students to the event and ensure that they are well-equipped to engage with the technology.\n\n### Duration and schedule: \n\nEvent start online : April 28\n\nEvent end face-to-face : June 18\n\nTotal duration: 1 Month 3  weeks\n\nThis event will be executed in different stages:\n\n**Virtual**\n\nDue to Gear\'s experience in various hackathons, we agreed to hold a bootcamp before the main hackathon, with a focus on providing workshops and educational talks. Each participating parachain will have the opportunity to conduct several workshops and Q&A sessions with the participants to get them excited and prepared to build on their platforms. We have created a schedule of possible time slots that can be occupied by the different parachains for their educational sessions.\n\n- April 28 - Zoom: Talk on-boarding web3 - official start pre boothckathon web3\n- May 2    - Zoom : Workshop Polkadot as the solution to interoperability blockchains. Workshop on Gear and first contract for Vara,- link for the academy, link for rust and link for javascript, html5, react.\n- May 5th - Zoom: First training and follow-up \n- May 12  - Zoom : Second training and follow-up\n- May 19  - Zoom : Third training and follow-up \n- May 26  - Zoom : Fourth training and follow-up \n- May 29 to June 14 - Team building and specialization by Hackathon track in Discord\n\nA more detailed schedule with talking themes will be presented later on, once all the participants have been confirmed.\nAs the educational events have already started, you can see some screenshots on our [web page](https://web3-g.com/web3hackathon2023/) \n\n**Face-to-Face**\n\nWe were also invited to host smaller hackathons in other regions of the country, so we decided to bring them together. There will be four regional hackathons held at major universities, with over 150 students participating in each one, working on solutions. The top three teams from each hackathon will be awarded free trips to the Mexico city Hackathon, with their costs covered as part of the bounty they receive. During these regional hackathons, parachain teams have the option to support participants both online and offline. We are working to ensure the events are held in close proximity to one another, making it easy for people to move between locations and collaborate with the students.\n\n1. UACAM University - Campeche: June  1-2  - 1st Hackathon \n2. UDG University - Guadalajara: June  5-6  - 2nd Hackathon \n3. Cetys University - Ensenada: June  7-8   - 3rd Hackathon \n4. Tec University - Monterrey: June  10-11  - 4th Hackathon  \n\n**Mega face-to-face hackathon**\n\nIn addition to the hackathon, we have decided to use the space at ITAM University in Mexico City to also host a conference. With a lot of knowledgeable people from both the DotSama and Mexican blockchain ecosystems present, we will have the opportunity to bring together top-notch speakers such as Pimpo (organizer of Talentland), Mad Crypto, Lorena Ortiz, Zona3, among others, to give speeches and participate in panel discussions aimed at spreading the word about the blockchain and Polkadot ecosystems to the community. We expect around 300-400 participants to attend this exciting event, with an additional 1000+ viewers tuning in online via the live stream.\n\n### Here is the schedule for the event:\n\n- June 16: Start of the hackathon with additional guidance and a focus on coding.\n- June 17: Full day of coding. Start of the conference with basic talks.\n- June 18: Early morning end of coding with judging to follow. Panel section and discussion, followed by a closing and awards ceremony.\n\n### Location: \n\n1. Campeche  (Side hackathon) - UACAM - https://www.uacam.mx/\n2.

CDMX  (Main hackathon) - ITAM - https://www.itam.mx/\n\n### Budget and execution:\n	\nThe bootckathon it\'s divided into 2 different events:\n\n**Side Hackathons** will be held in four different cities, each with 150 developers participating, for a total of 600 participants. The hackathons will take place over a period of two days and will provide a budget to the universities for the following purposes: \n\n- swag\n- event preparation \n- travel for the winning teams to the main hackathon\n\nThe budget for each location is set at **38,000 USD.**\n\n**Main Hackathon (300 developers)**\n\nThis hackathon will be run within 3 days in 1 main city. The conference will take place 2 days so there will be  space for booths, speakers and community. Ths are the main items of the budget:\n\n- Food And Beverage\n- Swag\n- Security\n- Event Preparation\n\nBudget main location: **92,000 USD**\n\n**Web3group  Event Organization**\n\nWeb3group will take charge of organizing the face-to-face hackathons with each university, coordinating with its suppliers and providing a team of eight individuals to handle various aspects such as design, construction, assembly, disassembly, and event organization.\n\nBudget: **10,000 USD**\n\n**Total Budget: 140,000 USD**\n\nA more detailed and structured budget can be found in this attached [doc.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17KftaGngDF7udrsxxG5S7fH3hxwHuaie/edit#gid=77211956) \n\nThis budget covers the expenses for this proposal, but not the entire cost of the event. The Gear Foundation will also cover pre-event expenses, including visits to universities, coordination of smaller hackathons, and basic expenses such as security and infrastructure costs for universities. Additionally, the Foundation will cover translation services, exclusive giveaways, and the closing party. The total amount contributed by the Gear Foundation will be $40,000 USD. This is excluding the personal that will fly and work to support the education and realization of this hackathons.\n\nWe will allocate the funds in stages, starting with the decoration of the side events and making a prepayment for the main event preparation. We are currently finalizing the details and will provide a more comprehensive timeline in the near future.\n\nWe have already secured the dates and locations for the hackathons with the participating universities. In the unlikely event that this proposal is not approved, we may have to cancel the main conference and limit the hackathon to students only. However, we are actively seeking additional sponsors from the VC community to ensure the success of the events, even if the proposal is not funded.  \nIn the event that this proposal will pass and we still will be mange to secure funds from committed VCs, we will return any unused funds to the treasury. We are committed to transparency and will provide a final report of all expenses, including invoices for larger expenditures if this is needed.\n\nLarge-scale Web3 hackathons were not common before the one we built and ran last year in partnership with the Gear Foundation. While Solana repeated the event this year, it was much smaller in scale, with only one university involved. However, as a Web3 group that started just under two years ago, we have several advantages. Previously, we organized hackathons for Web2 projects and corporations, primarily university-based. One of the UNAMS professors introduced us to Gear representatives while they were discussing the possibility of holding a hackathon there. By leveraging our contacts and expertise, we created the first-ever Web3 university hackathon. The event was a great success, attracting interest from many universities, and inspiring us to organize several regional hackathons and a main closing event. Our goal is to reach more students and universities interested in exploring this technology further, but it is a big lack of educated people, so this events can give a big boost. \n\nThis event is the culmination of two years of hard work, and we are excited to share our experience with the entire Polkadot ecosystem. By bringing together the best and brightest talent, we aim to spread the word about the potential of Substrate and Rust technologies to drive blockchain adoption across the country. We are confident that our event will provide a platform for developers to learn and collaborate, and we look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that emerge from this gathering.\n\nMy name is Jesus, and I represent the Web3 Group. As the main contact person, I will be responsible for managing the relationships with the universities and vendors to ensure the success of this mega event. Me and my team will travel to different regions to guarantee the smooth and efficient operation of the events. Web3 is our passion, and we are committed to delivering the best possible outcome. We will charge a nominal fee for our services, which will primarily cover transportation and salaries. Our aim is to be transparent with all parties involved, and we want to ensure that everyone understands our fees. We are not seeking to profit from this event or make a one-time gain. Instead, we view this as an opportunity to build our reputation and collaborate with others.\n\n'),(686,1,182,1446,6,1,33,0,'0xb329ef97313e1633f758b6a1265f5e8586758bab14a90626830d646c533db6bc',43,100,17820975,'FsnxqJnqWVNMZZgxaQdhaCk9c5sL3WSggRCRqp1qEzk1L2i',0,1683538698,26.82,1684681734,'FsnxqJnqWVNMZZgxaQdhaCk9c5sL3WSggRCRqp1qEzk1L2i',6,17823375,1684768668,25.35,NULL,69741,4570,29590,'Maintenance for the substrate-api-client May-23 to Jul-23','We\'d like to fund maintenance of the [substrate-api-client](https://github.com/scs/substrate-api-client) from May 2023 until July 2023. This is a continuation of the [Treasury Proposal: Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Feb-23 to Apr-23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88).\n\nThe substrate-api-client is a Rust library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC in a no-std environment. An RPC client is a library, with similar features as Polkadot-js. With an RPC client developers can easily interact with any Polkadot or Kusama chain. There are RPC clients for different programming languages. For Rust, the most popular RPC client is subxt. Subxt uses the Rust standard library (std). The Rust standard library is not available in certain environments, such as trusted execution environments (like IntelSGX) or certain IoT devices. The substrate-api-client bridges this gap,  providing a library that can be used in such environments.\n\nThis proposal is a follow-up of the treasury proposal [Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Feb-23 to Apr-23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88). View our [report](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88#agl5qxkd9WZSVyBV2G9Y) for details on our work there. We aim to seek ongoing funding. Since the funds of the Kusama treasury are currently limited, and many projects ask for funding, we decided to make a smaller proposal and focus on changes that are needed due to substrate updates.\n\nSee the [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2566) and our [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VZyGcRs9pvks_FCm5B0BO1sikZIsJjAYeJCuehL7jyQ/edit?usp=sharing) for details.\n'),(687,1,183,1835,1,1,33,0,'0x07a39a81f5cddab53e6764058f54d87b9b6f1bd46a971e6f7e79e8c077f54f6d',43,100,17821067,'ELkVhHcvaP9L43RK9SP6Wn3FBfusEN5EJe2gH7aA2ETiufP',0,1683539250,26.82,1684663242,'ELkVhHcvaP9L43RK9SP6Wn3FBfusEN5EJe2gH7aA2ETiufP',6,17823467,1684750110,25.19,NULL,93219,1488,35857,'OnFinality - High Performance Public Infrastructure (Q1 2023)','**Proponent:** ELkVhHcvaP9L43RK9SP6Wn3FBfusEN5EJe2gH7aA2ETiufP (OnFinality)\n\n**Date:** 8th May 2023\n\n**Requested:**  1,835.806 KSM (USD: $51,971.31)\n\n**Short description:** Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine.\n\n**Full Report:** [Kusama Q1 2023 Full Report/Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsf8h4wio7lyH0_yrSdSdJ4lGfSSepyscWixoBEdTxI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Raw Data:** [Kusama Data Q1 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kLH15a_iPl8F-DmDnYekGlDxnj3zx_-0FP3Meb3bKP8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n* * * * *\n\n## Original Motivation\n\nOver the last 3 months (January, February, March 2023) we\'ve provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Kusama and Statemine nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing reliable infrastructure services\n\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how nodes are running, what calls are causing errors, and where traffic is originating from\n\n## Service Details\n\nDuring Q1 of 2023, we\'ve made a large number of stability improvements to our Ultimate API service to allow us to add a large number of new parachains over the last quarter as well as support for multiple chains outside of Polkadot.\n\nFor customers that do sign up for paid API keys, we\'ve been adding more and more features to provide a better experience. Geolocation insights provide statistics about where in the world communities are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives.  We can also now automatically upsize the storage on nodes to prevent the risk of any downtime.\n\nOur customers are building cross-chain wallets, running some of the largest block explorers, and are indexing multiple networks - they\'ve all benefited from these API access restrictions, improved monitoring, and the larger number of supported Substrate chains.\n\nBetween 2023-01-01 and 2023-03-31 our Kusama API service has:\n\n-   Served a total of 2.08 billion responses\n\n-   Accumulated over 43,000 GB of data egress \n\n-   The highest daily total was 62 million responses in a single 24 hour period for Kusama only\n\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 33 million responses each day\n\n-   Stateme had over 190 million API responses in the period\n\n-   All time totals for Polkadot is 40,919,737,864 (nearly 41 billion) since November, 2020\n\n-   At the end of this period the 90 day uptime for Kusama and Statemine was 99.96% and 99.99% respectively\n\n## Enhancements\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter.

Most notably, this includes the new NFT 2.0 pallet (`pallet-nft`) on Statemine. This includes a number of new functionalities like smart attributes. More features can be found in the primary [tracking issue](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/11783). As the audit has been completed, this will be coming soon to Statemint.\n\nThis release also includes a [new instance of the Assets pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/2133), called `ForeignAssets`. Foreign Assets uses a `MultiLocation` as an asset class identifier and allows other parachains (and eventually bridges) to represent their native assets directly on Statemine. For example, the asset ID of the native asset of Parachain 9000 would be `{ parents: 1, interior: X1(Parachain(9000)) }`. The original instance of the Assets pallet remains, and is often referred to as the “Trust Backed” Assets pallet, denoting the fact that they are administered by an account that one trusts to have some off-chain, corresponding asset.\n\nFinally, there is a new runtime API to [query account balances](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/2455), which will return all the fungible assets (under the Balances pallet and both instances of the Assets pallet) that an account owns in a single RPC call. This should be particularly useful for front end developers.\n\n**Please note this proposal is submitted on Whitelisted Caller track: meaning parallel to this public proposal, the whitelist of the proposal hash for this submission is also up for vote by the Fellowship (link [here](https://kusama.subsquare.io/fellowship/referendum/38)).**\n\nIf the proposal is approved, enactment will happen in block #18,062,739. \n\nMake sure to vote at your convenience!'),(695,1,192,3105,6,1,33,0,'0xc072057fbcdbec2776b19958de6a5ed578e04785cd75e522a42072046e69680b',43,100,17924885,'HjHJ9m6kPGHDLmvqLrqJZw1EgDWnyaa2eKqsa58TNXkcixH',0,1684164402,25.92,NULL,'HjHJ9m6kPGHDLmvqLrqJZw1EgDWnyaa2eKqsa58TNXkcixH',6,17927285,NULL,NULL,NULL,1194,106463,1358,'GigMind [Medium Spender] Referendum #192','GigMind.App is an innovative recreational platform tailored for the Kusama ecosystem, enabling users to create, participate in, and monetize various workshops or sessions.

This communication layer will be open and accessible by anyone and any application, improving information flow and availability in the ecosystem.**\n\n***\n\nCurrently, communication in the Polkadot ecosystem is not only largely stuck in Web2, but it is siloed and segregated. Governance discussions take place off-chain, projects have to rely on Discord and Telegram to interact with their communities, and suboptimal solutions are implemented for connecting these Web2 accounts to users’ Web3 accounts. Furthermore, by forcing communities to live off-chain, user engagement with dapps is lowered.\n\nAt Subsocial, we spent three months researching the needs of the ecosystem, and began implementing the foundation for Polkadot’s Open Communication Layer. We realized that, although Web3 communities, and their communications, should be moved on-chain, there was too much friction with actually using a blockchain for this.\n\nTo address this problem, we created [Grill.chat](https://grill.chat) as a proof of concept for OpenComm, showing how easy it is for users to start communicating on-chain. The onboarding process is even faster than Web2 apps that we are used to, as you don’t even have to create an account; you just send your first message and an account is automatically generated for you.\n\nWith OpenComm, all governance discussions will take place on-chain, and the content and messages will be freely accessible by anyone. This means we could have ten different governance platforms, all connected to the OpenComm social layer, allowing anyone to access the full breadth of Polkadot’s governance discussions, despite their UI/UX preference.\n\nThis can be expanded to any project in the ecosystem, and does not apply to just governance discussions. NFT fans could discuss a specific NFT on Singular or Kodadot, accessing a single unified chat from different applications. Sports betters could anonymously discuss Zeitgeist prediction markets on-chain, directly from the PM webpage. Multiple projects are currently working to integrate OpenComm.\n\nPlease read the full [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CEOCnuz9ZAJO0srMQbODWBDtl0p3mzZ5/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs) for all of the relevant details including full context, milestone breakdown, budget, etc.\n\nThis topic was previously posted on the [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/an-open-communication-layer-for-polkadot/2842) for some preliminary discussion, but please let us know what you think here.'),(702,1,199,5,6,1,30,0,'0xf46c678fd5a0c0fa5b0812ba2fd6e455df330f9f6513a924205b62a6b58a62a5',0,10,17979856,'G1vFzWj69uQRrw8GmGqzLr1JycokGgdzc34E7WEgjhknQV9',0,1684495638,25.31,1684871028,'DfqY6XQUSETTszBQ1juocTcG9iiDoXhvq1CoVadBSUqTGJS',0,17981622,NULL,NULL,NULL,36159,2365,14653,NULL,'TO: Szegoo FOR: cumulus#2294 (medium)<br/>'),(703,1,200,3328,1,1,33,0,'0x66b2e0540eef0fb4163da4ee16e77dc7bc2a5b6e5d984cb523df1b2c1cc056f8',43,10,18021249,'F1wAMxpzvjWCpsnbUMamgKfqFM7LRvNdkcQ44STkeVbemEZ',0,1684745352,25.07,1685774766,'F1wAMxpzvjWCpsnbUMamgKfqFM7LRvNdkcQ44STkeVbemEZ',6,18023649,1685861460,27.62,NULL,127281,74165,58841,'Polkassembly Maintenance proposal Q2’23','Polkassembly is an integral part of polkadot and kusama governance.

This submission covers costs for April, May, June of 2023. The maintenance proposal alternates between Polkadot & Kusama treasury and we are requesting the Kusama treasury to provide funds this time.\n\nThis recurring proposal aims to secure the continuous operation and sustainability of Polkassembly, a vital component of Polkadot and Kusama governance.\n\nTo ensure the smooth functioning of Polkassembly, we request a recurring quarterly payment to cover essential expenses such as maintenance, operations, and human resources. The funds are allocated towards general maintenance, runtime upgrades, and infrastructure costs, guaranteeing the reliability and efficiency of Polkassembly.\n\nSpecifically, this submission addresses the funding requirements for the months of April, May, and June in 2023. As part of the alternating maintenance proposal between the Polkadot and Kusama treasuries, we kindly request the Kusama treasury to provide the necessary funding for this period.\n\nAttached below are key highlights of our proposal: \n\n- **Customization**: Implementing a customizable and dynamic notification engine across multiple platforms (mail, telegram, slack, discord) to enable users to receive personalized notifications.\n- **Preview Images**: Creating identifiable proposal preview images at the chain level, making it easier for users to interact with hyperlinks.\n- **Anti-Spam Features**: Allowing users to flag spam proposals and comments, with warnings displayed on the UI and moderation team action taken within 24-48 hours.\n- **Partnerships**: Integrating the option to build custom quizzes for proposers, collaborating with Proof of Chaos team to reward correct answers with NFTs. Partnering with Grill chat and Subsocial Team to facilitate anonymous on-chain communication.\n- **Content & Education**: Establishing a dedicated webpage for blogs, tweets, and digests from Polkassembly to keep users updated on initiatives.\n- **Audit**: Creating an audit section for proposals, enabling auditors to reach a wider audience by adding their audit links to proposals.\n- **Site-wide Improvements**: Enhancing discussion post linking for better community engagement.

This was an initiative to grow a Romanian community who didn\'t have any content available about Polkadot. \n\nWhile delivering the proposal for #Ref.46 I had continued to produce content on my main channel, KryptosChain including interviews with Founders from the Polkadot ecosystem without requesting additional funding from the Treasury and had been managed within that budget as the KSM price had performed very well between referendum start date and receiving the funds and I felt it was only normal to do that for the community.\n\nThis new proposal is to request treasury funding for a new initiative which I believe and hope will bring a new group of users to the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nTo produce a total of **116 videos** over a period of **6 months** of the following types:\n\n- Comparison videos between different ecosystems, Cosmos, Cardano, Solana, Aptos, Sui & Avalanche **x 52 videos** \n(Compare products such as DEFI dApps, wallets and NFT marketplaces from the above ecosystems to those on Polkadot and talk about the pros & cons)\n\n- General Polkadot ecosystem news **x 26 videos**\n\n- Open Governance news regarding treasury spends  **x 26 videos**\n(Kusama but will include Polkadot when / if it launches during this proposal period)  \n\n- Interviews with Founders / Co-Founders or other team members **x 12 videos**\n\nYou can find the **full proposal** [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JjhrPR0z50IZSXiI423HbAhsx_4GyiSNRQS3_6ohWcA)\n\nThe discussion can be found by clicking the link at the top of this page which has been linked to this referendum.\n\nThe requested amount is **1,651.17 KSM** , worth approximately **$41,395 @ $25.07** per **KSM** at today\'s market price.\nShould the price of KSM appreciate within the 14 days + the additional days before the payment from the treasury is sent, I will be transferring the extra KSM back to the Treasury.

Network level attacks are an unresearched area of risk for blockchains\n2. Ziggurat helps detect network level attacks before they happen.\n3. We propose to build out Ziggurat to support substrate based networks, starting with Kusama.\n\n## Short Description\n\nA Ziggurat is a rectangular stepped tower that uses precise measurements to ensure that each foundation can support the layers above.\n\nThis metaphor can be applied to network testing by defining three layers:\n\n- Conformance: adherence to the network protocol\n- Performance: healthy throughput under pressure\n- Resistance: the withstanding of malicious behavior\n\nZiggurat by Equilibrium, is a set of tools that allows node developers to test these three layers extensively and ensure that each new release does not introduce bugs, performance bottlenecks, or security flaws.\n\nAs mentioned in the conclusion of the recent [Trail of Bits report](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd11235b3950c2c1a3b6df4/62af6c641a672b3329b9a480_Unintended_Centralities_in_Distributed_Ledgers.pdf): It’s only a matter of time before a blockchain network is completely toppled by a network-level hack. This proposal will detail why this work is critical, and how we will go about solving it.\n\nZiggurat currently supports a multitude of other blockchains, but does **not yet** have support for any Substrate-based chains such as Kusama.\n\nThis proposal is for the **first milestone** of this process: Creating a test plan.

He has participated in the development of multiple peer-to-peer nodes belonging to blockchains and other distributed systems, usually concentrating on the network layer. Notable examples are Rust IPFS and Aleo.\n\nNiklas Long ([GitHub](https://github.com/niklaslong), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklaslong)) deeply cares about open source, distributed systems and data privacy. He has been on the Aleo Core Team since late 2020, mostly overhauling, testing and profiling their network; is the author of Ziggurat and an active contributor to Rust IPFS.\n\nKarlo Mardešić ([GitHub](https://github.com/Rqnsom)) is an embedded software engineer with a solid background in time network synchronization. An eager and passionate learner, he joined Eiger searching for exciting problems in the blockchain world and is currently focused on testing the network protocols. He takes great pleasure working in Rust and OSS community.\n\nMark Henderson ([GitHub](https://github.com/aphelionz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aphelionz)) is the VP of Engineering at Equilibrium. He has led the team starting with the original Rust IPFS grant in late 2019, through engagements with many of the largest names in Web3, and is now circling back to finish the critical work the team started with the original Ziggurat proposal. Core contributor to OrbitDB, Rust IPFS, and Ziggurat.\n\n## Proposal Team Experience\n\n[Equilibrium](https://equilibrium.co/) is a software consultancy and venture studio with a mission to further privacy and decentralization. Our clients include StarkWare, ZCash, Aleo, Protocol Labs, The Ethereum Foundation, The XRPL Foundation, Polygon and quite a few more. Our expertise is deeply technical, and we also employ economists and expert cryptographers to deliver results beyond the bounds of software development.\n\nMuch of our recent work has involved the design and testing of peer-to-peer networks in both familiar (e.g. libp2p) and customized contexts. Our impact typically falls into the following categories:\n\n**Bug Fixing**\n\n- detecting vulnerabilities using dedicated fuzz tests\n- squashing memory leaks\n- detecting and fixing blocking operations in asynchronous contexts\n\n**Implementation**\n\n- creating alternative implementations of network protocols\n- creating thorough network integration tests\n- simplifying existing implementations, suggesting protocol improvements\n\n**Profiling**\n\n- creating integration-level benchmarks\n- detecting and investigating memory/CPU spikes\n- introducing/increasing parallelism where applicable\n\n**Network Analysis**\n\n- crawling swarms using the P2P network layer (not RPC)\n- visualizing data to display on a web-based interface\n- gathering metrics such as reachable node cardinality, as well as node and network protocol versions\n\nFurthermore, Equilibrium has a taste for graphic and product design, seen in the execution of Vanilla, the [XRPL Hooks Playground](https://hooks.xrpl.org/), and the in-progress [Ziggurat GUI](https://app.runziggurat.com/zcashd) site itself.\n\nFor a detailed budget and breakdown of price, see the [attached proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRhFKo5w73wP5Nz8hg3xtw5GmPseNrzsarJLNNZqDZo/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nUnfurled:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRhFKo5w73wP5Nz8hg3xtw5GmPseNrzsarJLNNZqDZo/edit?usp=sharing'),(706,1,203,307,2,1,32,0,'0x2d6c67dbfe5d90919ea32d148b21749a373a42297cea1dc19e2b70437e294020',43,100,18036965,'GCMGu8sjEuEZuMZavo5PLvAhr8fJXAty76jDV1YPquG9erp',0,1684840098,25.66,1685759478,'GCMGu8sjEuEZuMZavo5PLvAhr8fJXAty76jDV1YPquG9erp',3,18039365,1685846190,27.38,NULL,99222,7337,41275,'OpenCommunity Governance','Unfortunately, the previously approved [Referenda #177 ](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/177) failed to execute as planned.

The first share for Q1 and Q2 2023 had been [approved](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/235) by Kusama OpenGov in Dec 2022.\n\nSince the previous proposal, significant changes have occurred around Kusama\'s Treasury. The implementation of OpenGov resulted in unsustainable spending levels, leading to a restrictive voter backlash aimed at safeguarding the remaining funds in the KSM Treasury. Considering the remaining funds available, Encointer recognizes the need to adapt its funding strategy. Instead of solely proposing to the KSM Treasury, we will now extend our proposals to the DOT Treasury as well, supported by the assertion that Encointer benefits not only Kusama but the entire Dotsama ecosystem. As DOT treasury proposals experience congestion and OpenGov is soon to be implemented on Polkadot, it is imperative to secure uninterrupted funding for our team and prevent any disruptive downramp-upramp scenarios. Therefore, we propose the following measures:\n1. This proposal to the KSM treasury shall cover our expenses for July and Aug 2023\n2. As soon as OpenGov lands on Polkadot, we shall submit a proposal to the \nDOT treasury to cover our expenses from Sept onwards\n\n**The amount of the proposed spend (1.) is CHF 213’000 ≃ USD 234’000**\n\nA growing part of KSM voters is in favor of **retroactive funding** by the treasury. Encointer claims that enforcing retroactive funding for common goods has significant downsides: Asking teams to front the costs themselves in cases where there is no return on investment will keep those teams small and impacts low. Besides Encointer’s established track record, we’d like to emphasize that the founder of Encointer, Alain Brenzikofer, has worked for Encointer without pay from the beginning, which amounts to well above a person-year by now. So, if you insist on retroactive funding, please consider approving this proposal on the grounds of Alain’s pre-investment. \n\n[Detailed proposal Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lUVpmTjE81_rwBR38H80rSiwYd3eoPZHE6TGykwlsSo/edit?usp=sharing)\n'),(715,1,213,0,3,1,0,NULL,'0x96438304473cf89856765805c128323ad0c38465cde7eeb405dbbcb38450bbcf',720879,100,18167730,'GkHAhyJEezrPuJ4CCytry4NfNU7nchh8zUq9RuKYfqRsUuT',0,1685628390,26.81,1686930498,'GD6J9zAkhPpNppdqD4JVRfTUjiV3ys62H7h96vyq8Wh8g9L',3333,18169286,1687017312,23.09,NULL,99025,2805,41277,'Moving a paraid to a new manager address - Kabocha','EDIT - *No-one has objected, so I\'m going to go ahead with this.*\n\nEDIT AGAIN - Passed and executed correctly.  Thank you to everyone who supported it!\n\nI\'m interested in the communities views on whether the following is technically feasible and whether they would likely support it, please.\n\nWe\'re coming to the end of the Kabocha parachain lease (paraid 2113), and we\'ve secured another lease on another paraid (2268).  Unfortunately, I hadn\'t realised that the parathread would instantly upgrade to a parachain and lock lease swaps, so we\'re going to need to use a root referendum to resolve it.\n\nHowever, there are a few other longer term issue that we\'d like to resolve at the same time, if possible.  The current paraid is on a regular single owner account.  We\'d like to move it to another account - probably a pure proxy so we can update control of the account as key people move in and out of the project.  I believe there isn\'t currently a way to update the manager of a paraid?\n\nWith that in mind, and noting that Kabocha will revert to a parathread in a few days, I\'d like to set up a root track referendum that does the following in a batch (in order):\n\n1. registrar.deregister(2113) - release the paraid from the current holder and free the reserved balance.\n\n<wait 2 epoch for offboarding>\n\n2. registrar.forceRegister() - with the pure proxy account, standard 280.3KSM deposit (see below), paraid 2113, and the head hash and validation_code at the point where Kabocha stops making blocks (not yet known).\n\n<wait 2 epoch for onboarding - might not be strictly necessary>\n\n3. registrar.swap(2113,2268)\n4. registrar.swap(2268,2113)\n\nMy assumption is that this will move the paraid to the new account, offboard 2268 and onboard 2113 as parachains, and Kabocha should start making blocks again.  Is there anything fundamentally wrong with this assumption?  Or, indeed, is it too complex for the community to allow, perhaps?\n\nValidation wise, we can set remarks from the accounts involved (the current manager accounts for the two paraids and the new pure proxy), to confirm intent.  Is this sufficient?\n\n[About Kabocha, for anyone not familiar](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/introducing-kabocha-an-experimental-kusama-parachain-incubated-by-the-edgeware-community/327)\n\n\nEDIT to add **validation on-chain remarks**\n\n[Paraid 2268 manager account](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/18149800-2)\n\n[New paraid 2113 manager account, via proxy](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/18149835-2)\n\n[Old paraid 2113 manager account](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/18154737-2)\n\n\nEDIT to add **notes on deposit for forceRegister()**\n\nThe fee for setting the parachain PVF and head is just under 280.3KSM (this is more than the fee when Kabocha was first registered).

With support from its core team and over 100 contributors, KodaDot prioritizes creators, developers, and community members from diverse backgrounds. The platform emphasizes environmentally responsible practices, collaborating with [Offsetra](https://offsetra.com/profile/kodadot) and [RMTerra](https://blog.kodadot.xyz/you-dont-need-to-go-far-to-help-the-nature-just-mint-on-kodadot-496fc60cd748) for emissions compensation and global reforestation efforts. KodaDot\'s success and commitment to quality have earned it the top position in GitHub\'s \"polkadot\" topics, demonstrating its strong presence in the decentralized application landscape ranking as [#1 dApp in Polkadot](https://github.com/topics/polkadot).\n\n## Overview of proposal\nThis proposal focuses on integrating RMRKv2 into KodaDot, a community-driven and inclusive NFT marketplace on the Kusama network, in response to RMRK’s shift towards Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support. The goal is to provide Kusama users with continued access to a sustainable and accessible platform for NFT trading using the latest RMRKv2 standard.\n\n## Funding requested:\n$100,000, divided into two installments ($72k for Milestones 0-3, $28k for Milestones 4-7)\n\n## Full proposal link:\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1EJ7OAUwKzC4wjjMATOJxZWLKo9kxS8137Or_Y4rME](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1EJ7OAUwKzC4wjjMATOJxZWLKo9kxS8137Or_Y4rME)\n\n## Requested amount:\n- $72,000 for milestones 0-3 (Completed)\n- $28,000 for milestones 4-7 (Ongoing & Upcoming)\n\n## Context of the proposal:\nBy integrating RMRKv2 into KodaDot, this proposal aims to fill the gap left by RMRK\'s focus on EVM and maintain a sustainable, inclusive platform for NFT trading within the Kusama network. The goal is to strengthen the Kusama NFT ecosystem through the integration of RMRKv2 and foster community engagement, innovation, and cross-chain collaboration. The implementation process, milestones, partnerships, and success criteria are detailed in the proposal context.\n\n## Objectives\n- Integrate RMRKv2 into KodaDot to provide Kusama users with a sustainable and inclusive platform for NFT trading and engagement.\n- Strengthen the Kusama NFT ecosystem through collaboration, innovation, and cross-chain integration.\n- Ensure continued success and growth of Kusama\'s NFT ecosystem, catering to creators, collectors, and traders using the latest RMRKv2 standard.\n\n## What happens if the implemenation doesn’t happen?\n\nIf the implementation does not happen, the Kusama community and NFT creators, collectors, and traders would miss out on the following benefits:\n- Seamless access to a thriving NFT marketplace that supports the RMRKv2 standard.\n- A dynamic ecosystem for artists, developers, and collectors, enabling more robust and versatile NFT creations.\n- Encouraging further innovation and development within the Kusama network, allowing for the expansion of projects and use-cases.\n- Enhanced user experience and greater trading opportunities within the NFT ecosystem as a result of a community-driven development process.\n- Improved opportunities for cross-chain integration, partnerships, and collaborations within the broader Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems.\n- NFTs, as long-term assets with potential for value appreciation, require a focus on growth and maintaining value. KodaDot\'s RMRKv2 integration offers unique content on the Kusama network, promoting NFT sustainability and value in the evolving digital space. With a robust custom implementation, KodaDot provides reliable data longevity for NFT transactions and serves as a dependable NFT explorer. Furthermore, KodaDot\'s efficient and optimized platform outperforms competitors, as its bundle is 270 times smaller, ensuring resilience in the NFT trading process.'),(723,1,222,2,6,1,30,0,'0xae6525072496b572c3f0a7c8c572ffdaa5934770074fe5ebf6991da6c3efba61',42,10,18381344,'G1vFzWj69uQRrw8GmGqzLr1JycokGgdzc34E7WEgjhknQV9',0,1686914280,21.20,1687190574,'HERTWZK4ZpmuXsEgW3UfL5x27XCdT5fE9x4QRbyNWifafdU',0,18386701,1687190634,22.75,NULL,81870,606,31774,'SmallTipper','TO: Szegoo FOR: substrate#14343 (small (2 KSM))'),(724,1,221,0,2,1,1,0,'0x8fd8209a483ff749f8964063cd5d6da60d8fb295b51e7ba65a9f9ea690f24c44',1482245,NULL,18378924,'GcDZZCVPwkPqoWxx8vfLb4Yfpz9yQ1f4XEyqngSH8ygsL9p',0,1686899718,21.33,1687785522,'GhNvKDa3PRY5ZyFP8Vj97TwCe5oUhTk7NEvmNMqjxHPGiPD',333,18440267,1688378850,27.19,NULL,889210,50,827552,'[Whitelisted Caller] Referendum #221: Upgrade Kusama to v9430','This referendum upgrades the Kusama network (Relay Chain, Asset Hub, and Bridge Hub) to v9430.

To fix this, we propose increasing the memory limit for PVF execution to 512MB.\n\n\n```\nset_config_with_executor_params {}: set_executor_params(RawOrigin::Root, \nExecutorParams::from(&[ExecutorParam::MaxMemoryPages(8192)][..]))\n```\n\n- hash: `0x1c356149b664ec3f7d89eeb56a3469bd5f468ae7fafa2b13f2423618db6c922e`\n\n- calldata: `0x332e040100200000`\n\n- Submit the preimage for the Fellowship referendum:\n[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x2000882c001c356149b664ec3f7d89eeb56a3469bd5f468ae7fafa2b13f2423618db6c922e](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x2000882c001c356149b664ec3f7d89eeb56a3469bd5f468ae7fafa2b13f2423618db6c922e)\n\n- Open a Fellowship referendum to whitelist the call:\n[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x17002b0f024076336ce5c2429a0c9ebdc17667391af846008847a8dbc6164ebfc076f172d322000000010a000000](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x17002b0f024076336ce5c2429a0c9ebdc17667391af846008847a8dbc6164ebfc076f172d322000000010a000000)\n\n- Submit the preimage for the public referendum:\n[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x2000282c03332e040100200000](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x2000282c03332e040100200000)\n\n- Open a public referendum to dispatch the call:\n[https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x15002b0d020ebe5ce9abcaf0e08e88086b99882b0f63862ee2c48f15f84c9c6658526a12d20a000000010a000000](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x15002b0d020ebe5ce9abcaf0e08e88086b99882b0f63862ee2c48f15f84c9c6658526a12d20a000000010a000000)'),(734,1,234,5441,4,1,34,0,'0x727612faabac8b34b9d6651d55e67e61fe04320b6c5fb0491e72ca06c6878ee9',1284,100,18760482,'FvrbaMus8iASyrQYkajQWDxsYvG5gb72PFPuvy8TvkFFVGn',0,1689192360,23.56,NULL,'GqC37KSFFeGAoL7YxSeP1YDwr85WJvLmDDQiSaprTDAm8Jj',13,18762882,NULL,NULL,NULL,104662,120991,50737,NULL,'Date: 12 July 2023<br/>Proposal to: Kusama common good fund<br/>Summary: 12 months independent research and analysis<br/>Term: 1st August 2022 → 31st July 2023   <br/>Type: Applied <br/>Structure: Retroactive<br/>Approval: Simple Majority<br/>Detail: https://forum.polkadot.network/u/rich/activity<br/>KPIs: https://forum.polkadot.network/u?order=likes_received&period=all<br/>Comparable: Web3 foundation researcher salary<br/>Cost: £100k <br/>VAT: £20k<br/>Total: £120k<br/>Total USD: £130k <br/>Price: $23.89 (2023-07-12 16:01:06 (+UTC), Block #18758035)<br/>Total KSM: 5,441.461<br/>Organisation: Decent Partners<br/>Structure: Hybrid  <br/>UK LTD company #10153409<br/>VAT number: 931912824<br/>Project Partner(s) - Richard Welsh<br/>Onchain: jXC7ghviUzVcVySg3eD8prB7C9m6VzK6cw2MTyMTDTUye5q<br/>Offchain: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rfwelsh/<br/>Conflicts of interest: none<br/>Governance: 1p1v<br/>Use of funds:<br/>- Working capital<br/>- Recoupable loans<br/>- Decision deposits<br/>- Voting<br/>Voting policy: <br/>Aye - directions<br/>Nay - domains <br/>Abstain - real or perceived conflict of interest<br/>Donations: FvrbaMus8iASyrQYkajQWDxsYvG5gb72PFPuvy8TvkFFVGn <br/>Patronage: patronage.shokunin.network/creators/FvrbaMus8iASyrQYkajQWDxsYvG5gb72PFPuvy8TvkFFVGn/?network=KUSAMA<br/>Contact: @lightbulbwelsh:decent.modular.im<br/>Website: https://decent.partners<br/><br/><br/>'),(735,1,237,914,1,1,33,0,'0x1f1b09c417e7b06c59bd23f14f01ca211f55ed725bf629506f4ca0c1043b8eb6',43,100,18772260,'EwR2jzx7gZSjxCXbkVZRm39W2fWGJtwXYYftQYdVfcJjtt4',0,1689263094,24.62,NULL,'EwR2jzx7gZSjxCXbkVZRm39W2fWGJtwXYYftQYdVfcJjtt4',6,18774660,NULL,NULL,NULL,44241,86593,19801,'RadiumBlock seeks reimbursement for Kusama Endpoint Service (Q2 2023)','The RadiumBlock team, an infrastructure provider for the Polkadot/Substrate community, is seeking reimbursement for the provision of RPC services for the Kusama networks for Q2 2023.

By leveraging on Polkadots cross-consensus message format (XCM) it provides standardized cross-chain liquid staking services for various networks notably Polkadot (vDOT), Kusama (vKSM) and the first LST solutions on both Moonbeam (vGLMR), Moonriver (vMOVR) as well as other multiple chains (currently 6+ chains).\n\nThis proposal would request the Kusama treasury to lend a total of **50,000 KSM (repaid with interest)** as base liquidity for the KSM and vKSM (liquid staking token for KSM) pair.  \n\nThis proposal is identical to **our successful proposal of last year**- for reference [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1606](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1606)  \nThe execution timeline of the proposal: [https://kusama.subscan.io/treasury/177](https://kusama.subscan.io/treasury/177)  \nThe repayment of last years liquidity loan will happen on the **20th of July, 2023** (1 year following the loan receipt in 2022).\n\nIn terms of Repayment details, before the 20th of July, Bifrost will post under this proposal comment.

Check our latest comment under the last proposal:** https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1606#uyr5UGFRsOIFcPN2olpP\n\n# Why Bifrost?\n\nThis Initial liquidity subsidy is fundamental in keeping the liquidity backing and support for broader utilities and use-cases across various DeFi applications and scenarios within the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystem and driving KSM related economic growth and adoption on both Substrate and EVM parachains.\n\nThis liquidity loan will keep driving the benefits achieved from our previous Kusama treasury liquidity proposal of last year for the broad Kusama ecosystem and for the community (below are **comparisons between last year\'s proposal and presents in terms of achievements and present developments**):\n\n(**Past**) Provide liquidity for staked KSM and promote the capital utilization of KSM in various DeFi scenarios and applications. This initial liquidity subsidy provides backing to vKSM being a catalyst in driving the expansion of KSM’s multichain economy.\n\n(**Present**) Liquidity subsidy helped us to growth KSM-vKSM capitalizations across:\n- [Zenlink](https://dex.zenlink.pro/#/info/pools/2001-eCSrvaystgdffuJxPVYKf8H8UYnHGNRdVGUvj1SWSiatWMq)\n- [Mangata](https://app.mangata.finance/)\n- [DIA Oracle price feed](https://app.diadata.org/liquid-staking)\n\nOn-going developments and collaborations  (check more details in Section #Motivation - application scenarios)\n- vKSM vault collateral for  Kintsugi kBTC\n- vKSM on Kintsugi DEX for KSM LST Pool (to launch this quarter)\n- vKSM deployment on HydraDX OmniPool (upon Bridge Hub DOT <> KSM completion).\n- vKSM on Pablo AMM on Picasso Kusama (potentially first vKSM/vDOT pair via Composable Polkadot - Picasso Kusama IBC).\n- vKSM as xcvKSM on Moonriver EVM Parachain for native utility:\n-  xcvKSM-xcKSM on Solarbeam DEX \n- xcvKSM as collateral for lending-borrowing on potential protocols such as Moonwell Apollo, Orbiter Finance.\n***\n(**Past**) Bifrost will develop the SLP pallet (vKSM minted pallet) SDK and Stable Asset Pool SDK for cross-chain vKSM mint/redeem calling convenience. The remote SDK call will facilitate cross-chain liquidation for vKSM/KSM.\n\n(**Present**) The vKSM minted pallet has been developed and it is called the “XCM-Action Pallet” in [Bifrost Runtime - XcmAction](https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost/tree/xcm-action/pallets/xcm-action), it currently works for EVM-compatible chains (Astar and Moonbeam have tested) contract ([https://github.com/bifrost-finance/xcm-action-contracts](https://github.com/bifrost-finance/xcm-action-contracts)) calling vToken minting/redemption/swap to Bifrost via XCM. It wlll be launched expected at the end of July of 2023.\n***\n(**Past**) Further improve the incentives for users to nominate and pledge tokens;\n\n(**Present**) Bifrost has incentivized vKSM, vDOT single-token farming for over a year to drive users to use Bifrost and to deploy vKSM on other parachains and protocols.\n***\n(**Past**) Improve the enthusiasm of KSM holders to participate in staking;\n\n(**Present**) The growth of KSM staked with Bifrost in the past year:\n**from 70’108.1841 KSM to 347\'823.6972 KSM with a growth rate of 396.12%**.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/37PNyKc/image-10.png)\n\n***\n(**Past**) Borrow 50’000 KSM from the Treasury and pay back with interest, increasing treasury funds utilization.\n\n(**Present**) Bifrost will repay 54,750 KSM with interest on the 20th of July, 2023. In using this liquidity loan, Bifrost has driven KSM liquidity use cases and continues to do so as mentioned in the section “Application scenarios”.\n\n## The significant improvements of Bifrost in the  past year\n\n- Bifrost Substrate vToken growth in the past year:  \nStimulate vKSM market share and use cases, launch 5 more vTokens: vDOT, vMOVR, vGLMR and vFIL.\n  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/VW5Z9WK/image-8.png)\n\n- XCM V3 improvements on Bifrost  \nThe implementation of XCM V3 on Bifrost replaced many off-chain services for SLP and SALP pallets, which simplified Bifrost’s ability to verify the message status sent to the other chain, streamlining the communication process.  \nLearn more details at: [https://wiki.bifrost.finance/learn/libraries/xcm-v3-in-bifrost](https://wiki.bifrost.finance/learn/libraries/xcm-v3-in-bifrost)\n- Treasury liquidity moved to Zenlink DEX:  \n[https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/5](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/5)\n- Treasury liquidity moved to Mangata DEX:  \n[https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/25](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/25)  \n\n# Motivation\n\nAs our original intention stated in our first proposal remains unchanged, Bifrosts long-term goal is underpinned by the following objectives:\n\n- Facilitate Capital Flow of KSM staking\n\nKSM, as the governance token of Kusama, about 50% of the total amount of KSM is currently in staking. **Bifrost hopes to activate the capital utilization of staked KSM while empowering the security of the Relay-chain consensus, and promote the activity of Kusama Staking.** Thus, Bifrost has enhanced [liquidity derivative protocol](https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost/tree/develop/pallets/slp) with XCM V3 for Staking KSM: vKSM, a liquid staking token that is anchored 1:1 with staked KSM and comes with KSM staking income. Bifrost hopes to borrow 50,000 KSM from the Kusama Treasury as the base liquidity.\n\n- Enhance the consensus security of Kusama network and reduce the threshold for users to participate in staking\n\nBifrost\'s KSM liquidity pledge agreement (staking liquidity protocol-SLP) completes the cross chain nominating of KSM by calling XCM at the runtime level, and SLP pallet completely controls and casts vKSM. In the whole process, the SLP protocol selects the validator with no security risk and reasonable rate of return through the governance on the chain to help users complete the one-stop nominate, and complete the final voting through the “[Sequential Phragménd Method](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-phragmen#off-chain-phragmen)“ on the Kusama chain. \n\nvKSM validators (108 validators now): [https://bifrost.app/vstaking/vKSM?tab=validators](https://bifrost.app/vstaking/vKSM?tab=validators)\n\nBifrost uses a hybrid mechanism of community governance + automatic scoring to select Validators behind vKSM, making the validator election process diversified, more efficient and transparent.  \nBifrost divides the seats of entrusted validators into two parts, the Validator White List (VWL) and Validator Boost List (VBL). A set of clear validator rating selection rules will generate the former, while the active application of nodes will render the latter and the Bifrost community votes on their application submission for approval. The SLP protocol will only entrust the assets staked by the user to the validators in these two Lists.\n\nVBL Discussions at Bifrost Forum: [https://bifrost.subsquare.io/discussions](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/discussions)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CVmV89f/image-9.png)\n\nMore details at:   \n[https://bifrost.finance/news/vet-validator-election-track-based-on-bifrost-open-gov-for-the-multichain](https://bifrost.finance/news/vet-validator-election-track-based-on-bifrost-open-gov-for-the-multichain)\n\nIn  Q3 of 2023, Bifrost will launch a governance voting track dedicated to validator elections: Validator Election Track (VET) in conjunction with OpenGov. The VWL and VBL need to pass the VET voting process before officially taking effect.\n\nTherefore, vKSM can help any user willing to stake, complete the pledge without knowledge threshold, and use governance screening to improve the overall staking quality. Staking with mobility will be integrated with rich DeFi scenes to stimulate more users to participate in the nominated proof of stake.\n\n## vKSM utility “implementation plan”\n### Application scenarios\n\nXCM-action: take KSM staking to Multichain\n\nThe function of XCM-Action is to deploy the vToken\'s mint, redeem, and Swap entry on Multi-chain, making it easier for users from different ecosystems to participate in \"Stake KSM with Bifrost\" or \"Stake DOT with Bifrost\".  \nAt the current stage, XCM-Action has completed several stages of development work:\n\n1. Bifrost XCM-Action Pallet Development;  \n2. XCM-Action Contract and SDK deploy on EVM-compatible chains: Astar and Moonbeam;  \n3. Testing XCM-Action runtime logics with Astar Alpha and Moonbase testnets;  \n\nNext Steps:\n\n- May 2023 | Register xc-vKSM and xc-vDOT on Moonriver and Moonbeam, launch XCM-Action runtime on Moonriver and Moonbeam production.\n\n- May 2023  | List vKSM on Pablo DEX on Picasso and create the first vKSM/vDOT pair using Composables’ Centauri IBC bridge (Polkadot ⇔ Kusama).\n\n- May-June 2023 | Test the cross-chain settlement function of vKSM and vDOT for XCM-Action using DIA vKSM PoR + Market price feed and Astar lending protocol.\n\n- June 2023  | List vKSM on Kintsugi DEX for KSM LST Stablepool and enable vKSM as a new vault type collateral for kBTC.\n\n- June 2023 | Launch the Bifrost xc-vKSM Mint & Redeem page on Moonriver ecosystem, guiding Moonriver ecosystem users to stake KSM directly in the EVM environment without manually cross-chain to Bifrost.\n\n- June 2023  | List xcvKSM on Solarbeam DEX on Moonriver and launch the xcvKSM-xcKSM pool.\n\n- June 2023  | Upon the successful completion of the native Polkadot ⇔ Kusama bridge via Bridge Hub, list vKSM on HydraDX Omnipool.\n\n- June-Aug 2023 | Use price feeds such as  DIA + Chainlink price feed to promote xcvKSM as a lending and borrowing collateral on protocols such as Orbiter Finance, Moonwell Apollo (TBC).\n\n- Aug-Dec 2023 | Enable xcm-action contract and SDK on Ethereum mainnet and L2s (rely on Polkadot ⇔ Ethereum bridge), promote vKSM utilities and Bifrost LSTs Hackathon in Ethereum.\n\n# Proposal\n\n**Amount**:  \nWe apply to borrow 50,000 KSM liquidity subsidy from the Kusama Treasury.\n\n**Liquidity subsidy**:  \nFor a detailed description, please see the section “Liquidity Loan and Repayment Process” below.\n\n## On-chain instruments used to provide liquidity to this proposal  \n1. **Zenlink DEX**   \nZenlink is an underlying cross-chain DEX protocol based on Polkadot, deployed on Bifrost parachain and Moonbeam EVM.  \n\nWhy Zenlink?\n- Bifrost native DEX, provides basic AMM exchange functionality for vKSM native users of Bifrost.\n\nAdditional Information  \nWebsite: [https://zenlink.pro/](https://zenlink.pro/)  \nGithub: [https://github.com/zenlinkpro](https://github.com/zenlinkpro)  \n\n2. **Mangata DEX**  \nMangata is a next-generation DEX that makes tokens from all ecosystems tradable on a single exchange. It features gasless swaps, prevents front-running and MEV without additional fees, and secures the network with the revolutionary proof-of-liquidity consensus.\n\nWhy Mangata?\n- No Front-running/MEV\n- Gasless swaps\n- Proof of Liquidity staking, stake is used as liquidity in Mangata DEX.\n- Liquidity bootstrapping\n\nAdditional Information  \nWebsite: [https://www.mangata.finance/](https://www.mangata.finance/)  \nGithub: [https://github.com/mangata-finance](https://github.com/mangata-finance)  \n\n3. **Kintsugi**  \nKintsugi is a blockchain network that allows bitcoin holders to utilize their assets within the Kusama network. Kintsugi’s kBTC aims to open the value of bitcoin to Kusama by enabling bitcoin based transactions across other Kusama parachains such as Bifrost, Karura, Shiden and Moonriver.\n\nWhy Kintsugi?  \n- Use BTC across Kusama ecosystem\n- vKSM as kBTC valut collateral\n- vKSM as part of the KSM LST pool\n- KSM stakers can utilize kBTC in border DeFi use cases\n\nAdditional Information  \nWebsite: [https://www.interlay.io/kintsugi](https://www.interlay.io/kintsugi)  \nGithub: [https://github.com/interlay](https://github.com/interlay)  \n\n# Managing the funds and Repayment process\n\nTracking Borrowing and Repayment Process\n\nBifrost will complete the borrowing/repayment process of the 50,000 KSM subsidy through a fully open and transparent process on Kusama and Bifrost governance.\n\n**Borrowing Process**\n\n- Kusama side  \n1. Apply to Kusama treasury to borrow 50,000 KSM to the ParaId2001 (F7fq1jMmNj5j2jAHcBxgM26JzUn2N4duXu1U4UZNdkfZEPV) beneficiary through the (Treasury::propose_spend) method of the treasury module on Kusama.\n\n- Bifrost side\n1. Generate Bifrost treasury derived address via Utility::derivative_account_id method;\n2. Through the Tokens::set_balance method, an additional 50,000 KSM will be issued on Bifrost treasury derived address;\n3. Transfer 50,000 KSM from Bifrost treasury derived address to the treasury (eCSrvbA5gGNYdM3UjBNxcBNBqGxtz3SEEfydKragtL4pJ4F) address via the Tokens::force_transfer method;\n4. Mint 25,000 KSM into about 25,000 vKSM via VtokenMinting::mint method;\n5. Add 25,000 KSM and corresponding minted 25,000 vKSM trading pairs to Zenlink and Mangata to provide liquidity.\n- Additional\n1. In the actual transaction, steps 4 and 5 need to be called through the utility.dispatchAs method.\n2. In the actual transaction, steps 1-5 need to be packaged into one transaction through utility.batchAll.\n\n**Repayment process**\n\n- Bifrost side\n1. Remove liquidity from DEXs, retrieve the liquidity of the KSM-vKSM trading pair to the treasury account;\n2. With the VtokenMinting::redeem method, almost 25,000 vKSM is converted back to more than 25,000 KSM;\n3. Transfer 50,000 KSM from Bifrost treasury address to treasury derived address via Tokens::force_transfer method and set_balance to 0;\n4. Transfer 4,750 KSM (one year 50,000 KSM staking rewards from vKSM) from Bifrost Treasury to Bifrost Sovereign account on Kusama via the XCM;\n5. Initiate a proposal on Kusama, repay 54,750 KSM to the Treasury.\n\n- Kusama side\n1. Return roughly 54,750 KSM from ParaId2001 to Kusama treasury address (F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29).\n\nAbout redeem LPs on DEXs:\n\nFor non-Substrate DEXs:  \nSince XCM currently does not support remotely calling Solarbeam\'s contract from Bifrost to complete the provide/redeem LP operations, Bifrost can only use the multisig solution of Bifrost Council members to operate xcKSM and xcvKSM on Solarbeam.\n\nFor Substrate DEXs:  \nWe will execute though governance via HRMP transactions, below are past cases:  \n- Treasury liquidity moved to Zenlink DEX:  \n[https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/5](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/5)\n- Treasury liquidity moved to Mangata DEX:  \n[https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/25](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/25)\n'),(738,1,238,332,1,1,32,0,'0x933306fabe07bf701f947580f377877ce2ddf094ae5bb1fe42f8878222449627',43,100,18804766,'EoH7Yh7S5pqwLz4fTakZcZrvyLB288ifbwhhXoXwwzrPZ5W',0,1689458430,24.58,1690511646,'EoH7Yh7S5pqwLz4fTakZcZrvyLB288ifbwhhXoXwwzrPZ5W',3,18807166,1690598058,23.25,NULL,41984,25288,22259,'Polkashots.io Cloud Costs January-April 2023','Dear Kusama Community,\n\n[Polkashots.io](https://polkashots.io) was the first snapshot service for validators and node operators available since Early 2021.

This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we\'ve made Github issues based on behaviour we\'ve observed)\n\nBackground on our RPC Service\n=============================\n\nSince inception in November 2020 we have made a large number of improvements to our Ultimate API service focussing on three key areas; performance/reliability, providing more value from our Ultimate API service, and cost optimisation.\n\n### Performance/Reliability\n\nOnFinality is operationally striving for a minimum of 99.99% reliability, which means less than an hour of downtime each year.  We proudly display and share our [90 day uptime statistics](https://status.onfinality.io/) for each network publicly [here](https://status.onfinality.io/uptime/r40wwpclbwzm).\n\nWe have invested hugely into a team dedicated to optimising our application gateway and caching layer to ensure that we provide the fastest possible service for our customers. We run clusters in 5 different regions (North Virginia, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Singapore, and Australia) and across 3 different cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Alicloud) to ensure that we are fault tolerant to any single region or cloud provider ceasing service.\n\n### Providing more value from our Ultimate API service\n\nFor customers that do sign up for paid API keys, we\'ve been adding more and more features to provide a better experience. [Geolocation insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-adds-geolocation-insights-for-dapps-and-api-apps/) provide statistics about where in the world communities are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives.  We can also now [automatically upsize the storage on nodes](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-developer-update-auto-expand-storage-for-dedicated-nodes/) to prevent the risk of any downtime.\n\nFinally, in Q2 of 2023 OnFinality [launched Trace API](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-trace-api-for-unprecedented-visibility-into-your-dapps/) support which was a huge enhancement allowing unprecedented visibility for dApp builders. Trace API captures and records vital information otherwise not available through regular RPC methods and extrinsics (such as complete XCM transfer records and complete list of balance changes). These APIs are essential in order for [developers like Polkaholic](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinalitys-new-trace-api-helping-colorful-notion-get-trace-data-from-over-40-substrate-chains/) to parse and understand XCM transactions.\n\n### Cost Optimisation\n\nOnFinality is very conscious about providing a strong level of support for Polkadot/Kusama at an extremely competitive price. Cost saving measurement has been a significant focus on behalf of our customers, with advanced rate limiting controls implemented. We can, for example, rate limit each client on a burst and sustained basis and based on the request methods that they are calling (e.g. each state_traceBlock request is rate limited 45x more than chain_getBlock), [read more about these advanced rate limiting tools that we\'ve developed here](https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/public-rate-limits).\n\nMeaning that we can continue to provide generous public API endpoints for over 40 different networks for common-good applications, but restrict access to high volume users that abuse this free service. We\'ve been able to manage our costs significantly on behalf of our customers as a result. \n\nWe\'ve [developed and shared our approach towards service sustainability](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1270), with the introduction of a \'Paid API Revenue Share Discount\' scheme. In this scheme OnFinality pools the revenue from customers that pay for higher API pricing plans and distributes this revenue pool to partners that currently pay for and own each API endpoint proportionally based on the number of paid API requests that go to that API endpoint. The scheme was introduced in Q1 of 2023 and resulted in a discount to [Kusama\'s Q1 treasury proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/183) of $281.90.\n\nOur cost optimisation efforts were validated in Q1 as we had the lowest cost per million responses across all of the major RPC providers that lodged a proposal to the Polkadot treasury. You can see how our costs compared to other RPC providers in the ecosystem during Q1 [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Utw2HfS7I5Gpyhrl9ejuj0CrQ4AcChGFteXdw0a8tro/edit#gid=0).\n\nService Details\n===============\n\nDuring Q2 of 2023, we\'ve made a number of new improvements to our Ultimate API service that address performance/reliability, features, and costs.\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n-   [Launched Trace API](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-trace-api-for-unprecedented-visibility-into-your-dapps/) allowing unprecedented visibility for dApp builders. Trace API captures and records vital information otherwise not available through regular RPC methods and extrinsics (such as complete XCM transfer records and complete list of balance changes). These APIs are essential in order for [developers like Polkaholic](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinalitys-new-trace-api-helping-colorful-notion-get-trace-data-from-over-40-substrate-chains/) to parse and understand XCM transactions.\n\n-   [Geographical Insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-adds-geolocation-insights-for-dapps-and-api-apps/) - API key owners can view statistics about where in the world your community are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives\n\n-   [Clarify our IP address handling](https://blog.onfinality.io/how-does-onfinality-deal-with-personal-information/) - OnFinality does not, and will never, correlate or link specific wallet addresses to the IP address or request origin making the RPC request\n\n-   Added support for a number of new networks, including Anmol, HydraDX, Equilibrium, as well as Osmosis, Evmos, Harmony, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fuse, DFK Chain, Celo, and Klaytn from outside the ecosystem. OnFinality is a new one stop shop for all of your RPC needs from multiple ecosystems.\n\n-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.\n\n-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to any  substrate team\n\nOur customers are building cross-chain wallets, running some of the largest block explorers, and are indexing multiple networks - they\'ve all benefited from these API access restrictions, improved monitoring, and the larger number of supported Polkadot chains. You can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/).\n\nBetween 2023-04-01 and 2023-06-30 our Kusama API service has:\n\n-   Served almost 2  billion (1,962,258,944) responses\n\n-   Accumulated over 31,000 GB of data egress\n\n-   The highest daily total was over 42 million responses in a single 24 hour period for Kusama alone\n\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 10 million responses each day\n\n-   Statemine had over 130  million (132,310,628) API responses in the period\n\n-   All time totals for Kusama is 42,881,996,808 (over 42 billion) since November, 2020\n\n-   At the end of this period the 90 day uptime on Kusama and Statemine was 99.93% and 100% respectively\n\nCostings\n========\n\nThis proposal includes combined running costs for our infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine. The total combined running cost is USD $62,110.28 - [raw data is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mb5GI3KAz3mza0qehduwd332DtVoPNrpR2MIZHr2ZCc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**For breakdown of costings and more information, read the full proposal here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHIh9fcqbhiDz0tqAFTaxm2-zU56XK_3CpM0r_CcvvU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHIh9fcqbhiDz0tqAFTaxm2-zU56XK_3CpM0r_CcvvU/edit?usp=sharing)'),(741,1,242,609,1,1,33,0,'0xabd05c0e7c410d3a09c7eba1db0d661419c1332ef18c3a74cb9c78296cd06fd7',43,100,18853383,'Et9M3rrA7H2kHQEGRXHxufcp9HTEmFirMWtKHvjoJ85r1C9',0,1689750630,24.25,NULL,'Et9M3rrA7H2kHQEGRXHxufcp9HTEmFirMWtKHvjoJ85r1C9',6,18855783,NULL,NULL,NULL,59225,83018,29622,'[medium spender] Request for maintenance of Stakeworld\'s RPC infrastructure and bootnodes','This request is for funding of:\n\n* Maintaining public [RPC services](https://stakeworld.io/docs/rpc) for kusama, kusama commons (assethub, bridgehub), encointer, westend and westend assethub (all included in [polkadot.js.org](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss://ksm-rpc.stakeworld.io))\n* Maintaining [bootnodes](https://stakeworld.io/docs/bootnode) for kusama and westend\n\nIn the previous 30 days we served:\n* 133.390.042 Kusama & common chains RPC requests\n* 37.080.656 Westend & common chains RPC requests\n\nLive data can be seen on our [webpage](https://stakeworld.io/docs/rpc#live-stakeworld-rpc-data). \n\nIt is a follow-up of our [previous opengov](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/189) and [earlier](https://github.com/stakeworld/stakeworld-treasury#readme) [ended](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/171) Infrastructure Maintenance Bounty requests. \n\nPrevious request were more post funded (requested at the end or after a period) while this one is more pre funded (at the beginning of the period).

There are [RPC clients](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-tools-index#rpc-and-api-tools) for different programming languages. For Rust, the most popular RPC client is [subxt](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt). Subxt uses the Rust standard library (std).

As Gavin mentioned in this CoinDesk article, WebAssembly is the future of smart contracts. Also, as mentioned in the approved WASM smart contracts bounty, smart contracts parachains lead the ecosystem in terms of market adoption. However, despite WASM tech having a lot to offer, it\'s not being widely used now simply because of the lack of proper tooling and ecosystem infrastructure products.</p>\n<p>OpenBrush is a core infrastructure product, a starting point, and a base for every ink! dApp. Nineteen production-grade teams and three parachains currently use OpenBrush. This proposal is the delivery of the previously approved development of the successful product, proposing the most developer-needed features validated by market feedback.</p>\n<p>Please note that we did additional research and have made the decision not to proceed with the planned and approved 12th milestone and are not requesting funding for it. However, we were forced to do some additional scope of work in order to fix unexpected issues after the Rust nightly toolchain\'s latest release.

Our main goal hasn\'t changed: we want to make the governance proposals process within the Polkadot community better, more open, and more successful. \nThis proposal outlines our plan to bring our successful proposal auditing process, first started on the Kusama Network, to the Polkadot Network. It builds on the work of the OpenCommunity Governance project, which has been running on the Kusama network for the past five months. In this period we delivered 80+ Audit reports on Kusama OpenGov treasury proposals.\n\n**Problem**\n\nWith the launch of OpenGon on Kusama, it became apparent that proposals are not very well structured, lack information, and include budgets that seem very hard to defend. Proposals can also be very diverse with a focus on different areas that not everyone can be familiar with. For all these reasons it is significantly time-consuming for voters to truly understand the proposal and cast an educated vote on it. \n\nA significant challenge in the current proposal evaluation process is the lack of constructive feedback during the discussion phase. To address this, appointed auditors will focus on being more involved in the earlier phases of proposal development. This proactive approach will help proposers receive feedback and address potential weaknesses in their proposals before they are submitted onchain, giving them time to evaluate the feedback and make improvements.\n\n**Milestone 0:  Prepare OpenCommunity Governance documentation**\n\nMilestone 0 focuses on adjusting the governance documents currently used in the Kusama network to align with the needs of the Polkadot ecosystem. This involves adjusting the Proposal and Audit templates, updating necessary documents on treasury sites, wiki, and GitHub, and initiating the audit process to improve the quality and transparency of incoming proposals with the set standards and guidelines.\n\n**Milestone 1: Implement OpenCommunity Governance**\n\nIn Milestone 1, the primary objective is to start proposal audits while they are still in the discussion phase and follow up the proposals onchain.\n\nA major challenge in the current proposal evaluation process is the lack of constructive feedback during the discussion phase. To address this, appointed auditors will shift their focus by becoming more involved in the earlier phases of proposal development. This proactive approach will help proposers receive feedback and address potential weaknesses in their proposals before they are submitted onchain, ultimately improving the overall quality of submissions.\n\n**Funding**\nThis proposal seeks funding of 2179.57 DOT split into 2 payments between auditors CoinStudio and Abdulbee.\n**All details can be found in the** [Proposal document](https://github.com/CoinStudioDOT/OpenGov/blob/7a2d85a36661f7fad95eaa5d7a99d18c8376cd7f/Documents/Polkadot%20Referenda%20%231%20-%20OpenCommunity%20Governance%20Proposal.pdf)\n\nAll the documents, previous treasury proposals, deliverables and reports, audits are stored on our [GitHub](https://github.com/CoinStudioDOT/OpenGov/tree/main).

The DIP is a protocol whose initial design has been carried out by BOTLabs, the initial developer of KILT, and which results in infrastructure work (i.e., pallets and crates) that other projects can integrate into their runtimes. The protocol allows any chain to become an identity provider, with other parachains able to choose the identity providers they want to cooperate with, opening up a free market for identity rather than a monopoly. KILT will be the first mover, but it is opening up space for other identity projects to enter the ecosystem and use DIP, beyond contributing to the overall DIP vision.\n\n\n The full proposal with the history of changes can be found here (read-only access): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-04dherCsMCDqVfwnGF8ZzCI1cOfSjbaBe4Jv4ilcjY](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-04dherCsMCDqVfwnGF8ZzCI1cOfSjbaBe4Jv4ilcjY).\n# How to verify the document integrity\nThe current version of the proposal document has been digitally signed with one of the DIDs that BOTLabs GmbH controls.

We\'re known across Twitter as [XCAstronaut](https://twitter.com/XCAstronaut?s=20) & [TinkerGabe](https://twitter.com/TinkerGabe?s=20). Today, we are opening a public discussion around our intended & upcoming proposal to the Polkadot treasury which is centered around the creation of a web application (named: Saturn Gateway) for managing multichain multisigs throughout the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nSaturn Gateway will realize an intuitive interface specifically designed for multichain multisig management & activities within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. While there are a growing number of multisig applications & interfaces being developed in the Polkadot ecosystem, this is much different from anything previously funded by the Polkadot treasury. Past & present solutions service the Polkadot parachain, with the ability to add support for other parachains, so long as they include the proper pallets in their runtime, and require users to manage those multisigs separately to each network. Saturn Gateway will instead be able to service any chain, regardless of the pallets in their runtime, and will allow users to manage their assets across multiple networks using a single multisig.\n\nRather than a proposal centered around bringing much-needed interfaces to the surface for the sake of catching up to other ecosystems, Saturn Gateway builds on the [Saturn Multichain Multisig](https://medium.com/@invarch/saturn-the-future-of-multi-party-ownership-ac7190f86a7b) protocol & [SDK](https://medium.com/@invarch/the-saturn-sdk-c46b4e40f46e) in order to realize a multichain asset custody solution that is beyond what other ecosystems have achieved & providing the Polkadot ecosystem with a narrative for housing leading-edge solutions.\n\nThe **proposal details** can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQIAdLbFPxtnNayfdkTxNZE2YKgc3Ej8UdjQWiG9y11gi2EkdUpNahKoE6SQ8ae7A/pub).\n\nAdditionally, a breakdown of the **budget & work performed** can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSNl-IO9j6XPPeW8QMIBR0DpUjkvItrDkxHl1vTbb7EvKxxtW44gL_BysHuM76pfSU3xXe_FRvk-X5N/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).\n\nWe have been working away at a prototype UI and have been proactively working towards the creation of this application for the Polkadot ecosystem. We are seeking $350,400 equivalent in DOT so that we may have the needed funding in order to continue our development. We would like to note that the development of Saturn was first started after receiving funding from the Kusama treasury, where we delivered on our promise to build out a multichain multisig SDK for the ecosystem. Additionally, any and all fees needed to use Saturn Gateway will be able to be paid for using the DOT token, adding utility to the token itself & realizing a smoother experience for users. We look forward to hearing the thoughts & feedback of the community.\n\nThank you for your time & those who have read our proposal. We\'re excited to elevate the multisig ownership & asset custody experience of Polkadot and hope that our proposal will be received favorably by the community!\n\n**UPDATE:** \n\nWe would also like to share that we have submitted this proposal to the treasury through OpenGov following over a week of public discussion, a public announcement of the proposal on the [June Polkadot Community Call](https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1667169978343096321?s=20), and discussing the proposal earlier today on the very first [Polkadot specific AAG call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdsPbeFzOQw)(skip to 1:17:00).\n\nAlso, we would like to outline that all of our code is **open-source** & that the repository for Saturn Gateway can be found [here](https://github.com/invarch/saturn-gateway).'),(776,2,7,250,2,1,32,0,'0xcbd1f9a71915b2fc7dfa358fb29cfef8b9dc27d1c0eea9d185cb0a889e4f5c85',969,100,15983800,'15D2JM548bqRuE45aDmeF2WqiKC56WtNnRmCxVSree9YKwVb',1,1686864216,4.44,1689079980,'16WWmr2Xqgy5fna35GsNHXMU7vDBM12gzHCFGibQjSmKpAN',100,15986200,1689166470,5.26,NULL,2678085,317570,1079481,'Nomination Pool Incentives - Fixing an issue with Motion 339','Dear community,\n\nThis OpenGov referendum seeks to re-submit the specifics of [motion 339](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/council/motion/339) which was rejected due to technical reasons, treasury.Spend would not work under the council approval.\n\nIn summary, the motion sought to reward \'high quality\' nomination pools using a deterministic evaluation system.\n\nThe details are below:\n\nAn [incentive programme](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1352) was initiated to reward high quality nomination pools.

The results of the analysis was posted (see last post) for public scrutiny for which none was received. With this said, we would like to proceed with rewarding 22 pools with 250 DOT as well as issuing a payout to PolkaGate of 250 DOT as well for developing the tool.

This proposal aims at correcting that by modifying the on-chain config.\n\n## Problem\n\n The `HostConfiguration::consistency_check` function asserts that the on-chain [`max_code_size`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/v0.9.41/runtime/parachains/src/configuration.rs#L376) is never larger than `MAX_CODE_SIZE`. This is violated on Polkadot since the concrete `max_code_size` on-chain is 10 MiB and `MAX_CODE_SIZE` is only [3 MiB](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/v0.9.41/primitives/src/v2/mod.rs#L331).  \n You can verify this by querying [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/js):\n \n```js\nlet config = await api.query.configuration.activeConfig();\nconsole.log(config.maxCodeSize / (1024*1024), \"MiB\");\n// Prints 10 MiB\n```\n\nIt is neccecary to correct this since otherwise the `consistency_check` will stay a No-OP with the [assumption](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/v0.9.41/runtime/parachains/src/configuration.rs#L1324): \"You cannot break something that is already broken\".\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nSet the on-chain `max_code_size` back to a sane value of 3 MiB. A larger value is not expected to work due to networking restrictions. Related discussions about this are in [polkadot/#7108](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/7108) and [polkadot/#7105](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/7105).\n\n## Impact on Para*s\n\nParachain/Parathread teams should check that all queued runtime upgrade have a size of at most 3 MiB (the `Runtime Size` as reported by `srtool`). A sweep across [all parachains](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/7108#issuecomment-1516220831) showed that the largest is currently 1.7 MiB, that is about 57% of the new limit.

They provide access to on-chain data in GraphQL format for all major parachains on Kusama and Polkadot, with more chains getting support as the ecosystem grows. They are being used as a data source for [Squids](https://app.subsquid.io/squids) and for efficient data exploration and ad-hoc queries. An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public [Archive Registry](https://github.com/subsquid/archive-registry/blob/main/archives.json).\n\n\nAll archives can be accessed and queried via an web intuitive GraphiQL interface and are often used as developer friendly replacement of a block explorer.\n\n\nFor example, here’s a query for the last ten transfers on Kusama blockchain run against the [Kusama Archive endpoint](https://kusama.explorer.subsquid.io/graphql).\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u/0/docs/ADP-6oF28QRWrAQx4x6nJNPA_fSg4c73ukxfq-ATwlJOaeMkFcveUEN3abJyXlkg0M5tgxMSU9_hY00ovl7JB0PIaZV25wlpNy9QiYTah8HYt1QcfnmUiLPz61vWbAjWe6yEsIrl_dVS68yi_skDsIhpTHtk0NqWhZ2HakawVgzv13cB0Zz2GFF1uD4WduGKh1cT71w21kf8XhbV9NU8bYkYjJht4UPz5CEmrc-J8V-1g6zjdMK0TWcbRtZE469tyZurbsR6hrxtz3AgcT-yBnIaFSR1RjuDt9cU4ON1EuhAYFfbt_hxKS5eJAmkJnoRN9b98lm3z-ENAW4F4lGD4eaefmLjW0Ni96jVwyx2-0qpj_FCU8M4Jv-ADArSOogQU6E4WMjJ0IXO0G0wvqcpJritTjnVfaMg1BWVP4coevffowL396wjU7-php3xXPT1cYJHRi9hob4LQQUYXeBz_oGA2mcZ-VTw8fonH_Q5H3MWRqaaPttS618JzrkVaeEGScCMF9qJ5tMwBeMFQ9rcG9njN1frHKgaco97oSsZsSygw-OsuCAyBta90ZmHWeHo3ZJqtRNBdE33rEzJlBvlVo4uCVbMnjE_64s5bz2-OQczY8bEdjD6v7g4awrLXZXwx1zdRnHkc5TZsnG65LhbYXzLus-n-drRCSuk-67GihaJrMul5IoKRgHaUJekuQVaFNnL4YhKAGOotb7tvvNCLdDtpfnwZdg_bhGrALNf8b4hGBfJL1_cHPeTeKj2IrsCBVz1cm7EQp6fx5VTXD3oJnwLkx09vmauHqlftCgqfzYjSvL5E2yWRHI5NZa5igjdV9UNPUvj_LB4-NvVx_RCofmUNjC62qj8AUYJH8z7RhIvGmpvpdesVlFgFqlB-VMhPd8emdb6l1089w7jrc3bODqhQuNtEbM)\n\n\nOver first Quarter of 2023 we\'ve provided a free public data indexing service for ~94 Substrate blockchains (some archives have been dismissed, new ones have been added), so that everyone interested in the projects can publicly access indexed data on Substrate Events, Extrinsics, Storage Items and EVM logs.

The APIs cover the most commonly used data for Pokadot, Kusama and a growing list of major parachains and is used by explorers (such as [Calamar](https://calamar.app/)) and wallets (e.g. [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/)).\n\nThe Giant Squid currently consists of two families of endpoints outlined below. The API endpoints for each network and the current status are available at the [Status page](https://docs.subsquid.io/giant-squid-api/statuses/).\n\n**Explorer API. The endpoint URLs follow the convention https://squid.subsquid.io/gs-explorer-${network}/graphql. Support queries on:**\n- Blocks\n- Events\n- Extrinsics\n- Calls\n\n\n**Statistics API. The endpoint URLs follow the convention https://squid.subsquid.io/gs-stats-${network}/graphql. Support queries on:**\n- Validator/Collator data\n- Account balances\n- Staking statistics\n- Nomination pools statistics\n- Transfers statistics\n- Extrinsic statistics\n\n### Achievements\n\n- Launched Giant Squid as a public API service for the community to explore relay and parachain statistics\n- Powering ≈ 360 projects in Q1 2023 ( ≈ 500 as of May 2023) including substrate and evm\n- Deployed new archives, expanding the list of available networks to 95 (increasing by 200%)\n\n### Statistics and

Currently, most parachains either implement their custom solutions and submit them to Ledger Live store themselves (max complexity level) or completely forgo the support for the hardware wallet.\n\nThis is where the proposed unified ledger app comes in. The app aims to simplify connecting hardware wallets, specifically Ledger, with the Polkadot ecosystem. This solution has the following advantages:\n\nNew integration requires just a repository pool request\nNo need to update the app on Ledger when new parachain integrates\nPolkadot/Substrate version upgrades don\'t require updating the app\nSupports both Polkadot and Kusama parachains\nRecently, we have showcased a proof of concept of the app and made the first steps to set the ground for future developments.

So there is a free-rider issue at play: Once we release our privacy-sidechain solution, everyone can use the code to run their own sidechains, even multiple sidechains for a single parachain are possible and user fees are paid in the parachains’ native token, not TEER. Integritee invests in this important use case but will be met by competitors who just fork the code as soon as the business case works out. This is a very good thing for decentralization - but must be financed.\n\nSo, the question is not a generic “*shall parachain teams get funding from the Treasury to build what they would build with VC funds anyway?*”. What we offer is not a product on our parachain itself which we charge TEER for (see fee details in proposal document): We offer an L2 solution for anyone to deploy - anywhere.

It is dedicated to fostering transparent governance and active participation within the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. The team is excited to announce its application to become a registrar.\n\n- On-chain identities in the Polkadot ecosystem are crucial for trust, accountability, and interoperability. By establishing unique digital fingerprints, participants can securely interact within the network. An on-chain identity fosters a reliable and verifiable framework for participants within the Polkadot ecosystem, which is governed by a defined set of rules. It enables seamless integration and collaboration between different projects and stakeholders.\n- It also builds accountability as the participants are vetted and there are multiple points of contact for an individual/team. Hence, when requesting funds or proposing changes, the network and its resources have an additional layer of protection via the verification process. \n\nThe goal of setting an on-chain identity is to enhance transparency, security, and the overall ease of interaction between the participants of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\nProblems in current on chain identity system\n\n- The current process for verifying the identity is extremely fragmented\n- The process requires a heavy reliance on navigating through PolkadotJS, which can be overwhelming to those who are new to the ecosystem\n- Twitter, Element and email verification is done manually and the process is very complicated for any user. The verification process also relies on availability of the registrar, creating further friction in the process. \n- The process is also broken away from the governance and proposal creation interface, which makes it difficult for a lot of the community as they need to adapt to multiple tools for serving different use cases. \n\n**Objective for Registrar Application**\n\n- The primary objective of creating the registrar application is to build an easy and integrated governance experience for all users within Polkassembly. \n- This involves building for automation of proposal creation, addition of education nudges on proposal evaluation, verification of on chain identities and comprehensive user level profiling with leaderboards and gamification for governance participants\n- Taking the onus for ensuring verification of users and building security for funds requested from treasury\n- All teams requesting funds should be able to create an onchain identity, verify themselves and use our product suite to create a multisig (via Polkasafe or any other publicly available multisig SDK) when requesting for funds\n- The time required for identity registration and verification will be reduced by more than 75%, enhancing the adoption of the feature and enabling a more robust and secure treasury management. \n- The number 75% was deduced by using the average time difference between the two methods for 3 unique users\n- The time required by the earlier method was 20-25 mins, and via Polkassembly will be approximately 5 mins\n\n**How will Polkassemby enable users to apply for on chain identity verification?**\n\nAttached below is a step wise explanation of how Polkassembly plans to receive and process on chain delegations \n\nStep 1 - \n\n- Discovery on on chain identity setup\n- Users will be provided with contextual nudges on Polkassembly for setting up on chain identity\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/5Y7H1GM/2-premiurly-1686255544576.png)\n\nStep 2 - \n\n- Educating users on what is on-chain identity and why is it important\n- Explaining the process of setting up and on chain identity and how verification works\n- Helping users understand how to identify users with a valid on chain identity\n- Clear communication on the total amount required (Please note the amount mentioned is representative and may vary based on market conditions)\n- The breakdown of the feed will also be provided\n \n![image](https://i.ibb.co/SrPRbYt/2-premiurly-1686255581602.png)\n\nStep 3 - \n\n- Providing the user with an interface to share all their social and contact information\n- The user will be allowed to choose any one of their address which they want to verify\n- They can choose their legal and display name\n- They can identify their social handles for further communication with the community\n- They are informed about the bond, which is mandatory while setting up an on chain identity \n- They are also informed about the fees charged for setting up or changing the social handles, which will be the fee per handle * # of handles being verified \n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/Nt9Z606/2-premiurly-1686255656060.png)\n\nStep 4 -\n\n- Confirming the fees and initiating the step by step identity verification process\n- Each social handle will need to be independently verified after the input is provided \n- Once all verifications are completed the success states will be provided\n\n ![image](https://i.ibb.co/54T72HK/2-premiurly-1686255690524.png)\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/MpmzBRY/2-premiurly-1686255723505.png)\n\nOther detailed steps and complete proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wYkC09wMjC6KstW2E9VtHLgoRd1bV_GLhYoTOQ8gv8U/edit). \nWe look forward to feedback from the community, suggestions to improve the product flow and support on our efforts to challenge the complex UX challenges of the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\nRegards,\nPolkassembly Team'),(792,2,24,25533,6,1,33,0,'0x64ff80a7ce42a4d52b210ecd875d1edaaf46b08a8dd87ba3a8cdaf80ec96dfad',42,100,16069523,'14PiQ7uar36zPMgEckA7qWUahYheavRL6NHCbUCkXXRNrFSc',1,1687379892,4.80,1689788508,'14PiQ7uar36zPMgEckA7qWUahYheavRL6NHCbUCkXXRNrFSc',200,16071923,1689875004,5.32,NULL,1549724,476201,774184,'Proposal: ink! design security review by OpenZeppelin (treasury proposal 2/2)','Given the successful completion of OpenZeppelin’s security review of the ink! smart contract language & Substrate’s smart contracts pallet, this community proposal is for the second installment supporting OpenZeppelin’s work.

The discussion post was made by my personal account. We have submitted this proposal after a week of public discussion and attending the AAG call.\n\n<br>\n\nDear Polkadot Community, \n\nMy name is Graeme Fox - Co-Founder & CEO of Societal. For those of you that dont know, Societal is a parachain that makes it easy to organize, govern, and grow on-chain communities. Its streamlined SaaS application is the ideal platform to run any Polkadot community’s operations, including the creator economy, protocols, social clubs, gaming, DAOs, and more.\n\nSocietal is asking for $187,342.47 USD / 38,249 DOT (as of June 21st, 2023) in treasury funding to provide the ecosystem with a platform for community operations and governance. Our application will work with any tokenized project in the ecosystem that is looking for governance, treasury, and community management services. \n\nAs it stands today, the Polkadot ecosystem does not have the creation, governance, and treasury management tooling products that the other major blockchain ecosystems do. By building these products, we will strengthen the Polkadot community by empowering NFT projects, DAOs, and protocols with a powerful platform to manage their operations.\n\nSocietal has not applied for treasury funding before and has a small amount of VC backing. We are asking the treasury to support our project so that we can finish off our product and start onboarding Polkadot users. We believe that after we do this we will be in a strong position to seek more VC funding, as the fundraising environment is currently at a stand still for early-stage crypto projects. Additionally, we strongly believe that the Polkadot ecosystem needs more usable applications, as most projects in-production today are DeFi or smart contract infrastructure platforms. \n\nSocietal has already completed most of the work required to be the homebase for decentralized communities in the Polkadot ecosystem. We are seeking funding to complete an array of final features of the product, including token import, governance, and proposal features along with the management UI to support them. We will also use the funding to conduct final testing and to start onboarding users. These features will allow new and existing communities to have access to a full suite of governance, treasury, and member management systems, which are currently not available in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nPlease find the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIhTjVdoQpge5oxkReYgLsJKgwRmyZww9-c2nE10IQE/edit?usp=sharing). It would be great to hear your collective input about our proposal, and I am more than happy to answer any questions or concerns that you may have. \n\n\n<br>\nMore information about Societal can be found here:\n\n- [Website](https://www.sctl.xyz/)\n- [Whitepaper](https://docsend.com/view/2gte2fd8wc4jp4rg)\n- [Docs](https://docs.sctl.xyz/)\n- [Product Demos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLukf6xUl2RLLdy7S81_Qua8SE_G0VhpKF)\n- [End State Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy-0FrfUIYw)\n\n<br>\nSocietal’s Track record/Accomplishments below:\n\n- [Attended Inaugural Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYLIdgp8m34&ab_channel=PolkadotBlockchainAcademy)\n- [Polkadot Relayers](https://twitter.com/societal_xyz/status/1595441713396723712?s=20)\n- Secured Three Web 3 Foundation Grants - [Grant 1](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/Societal.md), [Grant 2](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/societal_grant2.md), [Grant 3](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/societal_saas_pricing.md)\n- Accepted to Substrate Builders Program and Completed [Milestone 1](https://twitter.com/societal_xyz/status/1671607121904029696?s=20)\n- Multiple Polkadot Panel Discussions - [Academy Alumni](https://twitter.com/societal_xyz/status/1649519222949650434?s=20), [ETHDenver](https://twitter.com/joinwebzero/status/1631429180771676160?s=20)\n- [Rococo Testnet Deployment](https://twitter.com/societal_xyz/status/1663582461043802113?s=20)\n- [Product Walkthrough Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLukf6xUl2RLLdy7S81_Qua8SE_G0VhpKF)\n- [Scytale Academy Graduate](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7062441591453483009/)\n- [Accepted to Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator 2023](https://twitter.com/societal_xyz/status/1638670393140711426?s=20)\n- [Cross Ecosystem Engagement Initiatives ](https://twitter.com/societal_xyz/status/1658940826712436742?s=20)\n'),(798,2,30,146628,6,1,34,0,'0xeaf733254f48e3799ac206a15634f1d7ec9cf4c21d29c67d468ee48d756afec3',43,100,16084051,'15D2JM548bqRuE45aDmeF2WqiKC56WtNnRmCxVSree9YKwVb',1,1687467156,4.86,NULL,'1eGtATyy4ayn77dsrhdW8N3Vs1yjqjzJcintksNmScqy31j',400,16086451,NULL,NULL,NULL,2027584,8053184,1275676,'OpenGov submission of Motion 420 - Upstream funding Matrix.org Foundation','Dear community,\n\nThis is an OpenGov submission of [motion 420](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/council/motion/420) to help the Matrix.org foundation with upstream funding.

Field-tested with several hundred users, this protocol, known as *Encointer LoCo*, has proven its capabilities in pilot communities like the [Leu community in Zurich](https://leu.zuerich).\n\nWith new products, Encointer will not only benefit Kusama as a laboratory for personhood and local community currencies. It will benefit Polkadot directly as well:\n* The [faucet](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-sybil-resistant-faucet-for-all-tokens-in-the-dotsama-ecosystem/2757) will be useful for new token launches, i.e. on Polimec, but also for highly geo-targeted charity\n* The [personhood oracle](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-privacy-preserving-proof-of-personhood-certificate/2756) will be useful for privacy-preserving sybil-resilience for projects like KILT, frequency/MeWe, subsocial, jur, Saturn as well as many others\n* [BeeDance](https://encointer.org/introducing-beedance/) will foster community engagement at meetups and events everywhere around the world and could become a massively useful tool for Polkadot ambassadors\n\nSo far, expenses have mainly been funded by the KSM treasury. Starting with September 2023, the team proposes to be funded by the Polkadot treasury on the grounds that Polkadot and its parachains benefit from new products to be released in the next few months. See [milestones](#Milestones).\n\nOur [recent proposal passed OpenGov on Kusama](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/212) and will cover expenses for July and Aug 2023. The controversial discussions surrounding the Treasury proposal have led Encointer to draw some important conclusions:\n1. There is a pressing need to focus on the global expansion of Encointer communities, indicating a strong interest in reaching wider audiences.\n2. The primary reason for pushback was attributed to the limited funds available in the KSM Treasury as the proposal amounted to roughly 3% of currently available funds.\n\nWe understand that launching new communities and navigating the complexities of the protocol can be demanding, slowing down widespread adoption. But fear not! We\'d like to propose a viable solution: *BeeDance*.\n\n[BeeDance](https://encointer.org/introducing-beedance/) opens up a world of possibilities for event organizers to create their very own Encointer community, whether it\'s for a single event or a series of regular meetups. With BeeDance, organizers have the freedom to choose the event location and determine the timing that suits them best. The beauty of BeeDance lies in its simplicity and flexibility, making it far easier to launch compared to Encointer LoCo. While it serves as an excellent onboarding tool for LoCo, it also stands strong as a standalone protocol for proof-of-attendance (PoA). Expect more info on BeeDance to be published before [decoded\'23](https://decoded.polkadot.network).\n\n## Common Good\n\nProof-of-personhood will become such a fundamental primitive of our online lives that we suggest to acknowledge it as a basic human right. Therefore we claim it it is imperative to not let a for-profit entity take care of it ([like i.e. worldcoin as a bad example](https://twitter.com/brenzi5/status/1668224317874745344)).\n\n[Inclusivity in web3](https://polkadot.network/blog/introducing-encointer-making-web3-truly-inclusive), too, is a common good for the entire Dotsam ecosystem as it helps onboarding the long tail of the wealth distribution: A market that should not be underestimated.\n\nAs Encointer\'s offerings are non-excludable and aiming to be non-rivalrous, there can\'t be a business case here which would offer an ROI to investors (into Encointer). However, the Encointer protocol adds value to the ecosystem as a whole which will inevitably cause buy pressure to DOT/KSM.\n\n## Milestones\n\n* **July \'23** deploy [Encointer Faucet](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-sybil-resistant-faucet-for-all-tokens-in-the-dotsama-ecosystem/2757), enabling all reputables of Encointer LoCo to drip a tiny amount of KSM (to be followed by any tokens through XCM)\n* **Aug \'23** deploy the privacy-preserving [Encointer personhood oracle](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-privacy-preserving-proof-of-personhood-certificate/2756) for the nostr protocol, showcasing sybil-free social media public channels.

In this proposal, we are asking for **$72,180** for the content creation, event organization and marketing activities for the Polkadot ecosystem that Polkadotters did **since June 2022** with proposed funding **until June 2024** – thus we are asking for funding for our community activities for two years.\n\nFirst a bit of history - we started the first and only [Czech & Slovak Polkadot community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/232197797602358) back in the summer of 2020. After realizing that there isn\'t much quality content about Polkadot even in English, we decided to fill this gap as well. Since then we have published almost 300 original articles on our [Medium](https://polkadotters.medium.com/), promoted Polkadot and parachain ecosystem on YouTube interviews with various influencers (for instance [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHKo2DIq5S4)), organized and co-organized a couple of conferences and meetups, hosted some popular Twitter Spaces with parachain teams and many more.\nTo put our current work into some numbers\n\n - 1617 followers on our Medium 	\n 	\n - almost 150k views of our articles with more than 40k reads 	\n 	\n - almost 5k followers on our Czech and English Twitter 	\n 	\n - around 15k views of videos where we promote and explain Polkadot with various local influencers 	\n 	\n - organized two local Polkadot meetups 	\n 	\n - co-organized a couple of conferences where Polkadot played a main role with us being a speakers\n\nFor our future endeavors and how we plan to use the requested amount, please see the [detailed description and breakdown uploaded to Crust](https://crustipfs.info/ipfs/QmWqcN1erHTfTdiWTWxTfacyEby7uFpW21BXfUeuzYinJL). But in a nutshell, our aim is to keep delivering high-quality content and taking care of our local Czech community - with some extra perks like providing more content, developing a marketing strategy to reach a wider audience, starting to do monthly ecosystem recap videos, creating more Twitter content including spaces and many more. \n\nWe also plan to focus on governance in general - by reviving our regular [governance news](https://polkadotters.medium.com/polkadot-governance-news-7-opengov-on-kusama-hacned-is-it-a-good-or-bad-thing-a051b0a65f7e), promoting interesting referendums in the ecosystem and obviously taking our part in voting and analysis of proposals. We also take responsibility as a voting delegate and Polkadotters are available for delegation on the new Governance dashboard and in the Nova wallet.\n\nAs you might notice, we have already proposed a similar [referendum on Kusama](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/155) which unfortunately failed despite overwhelming community support. We believe that the treasury spending problem on Kusama hasn\'t been resolved yet so that’s why we decided to go to Polkadot once OpenGov is live. This is also the very reason we go directly for the proposal instead of having a discussion first - because it already occurred in the original proposal. And finally, we made the following changes and additions to our proposal to make it more attractive for token holders\n\n- we commit to organizing bi-monthly Polkadot meetups in various cities (and already did one in Prague since the original proposal)\n- we extended our funding period up to June 2024 for almost the same amount of money (thus asking for funding for two years of operation)\n- we created an onboarding campaign with rewards on Zealy for the Czech community that we will launch soon\n- we will organize more Twitter spaces with various Polkadot projects in order to spark more interest in the community\n\nThank you for your support!\n\nYours Polkadotters :-)\n\nThe full text of our proposal can be found uploaded to [Crust](https://crustipfs.info/ipfs/QmWqcN1erHTfTdiWTWxTfacyEby7uFpW21BXfUeuzYinJL)\n\nP.S.

I started with translating articles in my native language on my medium page and I am still doing this, but I wanted also to start creating my own piece of content to share and spread the word. 4 months ago I started a YouTube channel and started to create educational videos by using animations.

You can check the videos created until now on my channel https://www.youtube.com/@AnimatedCrypto.

Notifi’s platform offers the devtools designed for web3 projects to start sending near real-time alerts to end users. This allows web3 developers and marketers to create highly custom messages, enabling web3 teams to identify who to message and how the message is delivered.\nWe are looking for a grant from the Polkadot grant program that can cover the full cost of providing our services to both the Polkadot relay chain itself and its core ecosystem parachains. We believe that our platform can facilitate the increase in adoption of the Polkadot-native platforms by new and existing users in web3.\n\n Over the last several months, we worked closely with Parity to engage with the core Polkadot ecosystem parachains and wallets, and we received tremendous interest from the broader community to provide our notification services to power dApps and parachains. 16 parachains, wallets and ecosystem partners have confirmed their need for Notifi’s services and committed support for Notifi’s grant proposal:\n\nNotifi is looking for a grant from the Polkadot grant program that can cover the full cost of providing our services to both the Polkadot relay chain itself and its core ecosystem members. We believe that our platform can facilitate the increase in adoption of the Polkadot-native platforms by new and existing users in web3.\n\n**Problem Notifi is Solving** : Building notifications and alerts within web3 is a key pain point for all B2C platforms given the decentralized nature of user onboarding experience via wallets. As soon as end users onboard onto web3 dApps, the connection between the business and the consumer are immediately disintermediated, where the web3 project is not able to contact the users directly to provide useful information. We’re solving problems for two key groups of users: 1) web3 users, and 2) web3 builders and communities.\n\n**Notifi\'s Solution** Notifi’s platform bridges the communication gap between web3 projects and its communities by providing the dev toolkit and infrastructure designed specifically for web. Notifi’s solution is a highly customizable, white-labelled communication platform that can be embedded natively into web3 dApps. Additionally, we’re able to monitor and parse smart contract events at a very granular level, enabling custom notifications, including loan health, governance proposals and staking alerts that are unique to parachains / dApps, while also doing it at scale. Improved notifications and communications to end users ultimately drives user activation, engagement, and retention, which is crucial for the broader Polkadot ecosystem to continue growing and remain competitive.\n\nWe hope to work closely with the Polkadot community at large to receive feedback on our proposal. We also appreciate that the Polkadot ecosystem is a truly community-driven ecosystem and welcome and invite feedback from the community to let us know which parachains should be included in the first batch.\n\n--\n\nPlease review our full draft proposal here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y4Osu4gPyxpdAuYtz1xCL4QhnogvAixPNMdqdYTGrPw/edit](url)'),(809,2,42,0,9,1,33,0,'0x5743a34e1fd2472e267dfab41adbdd24040fd4e0484acc0ea1c9dc35f2365691',36,100,16135148,'13Ghf2T883ZobjngC1BAgR1BWvK2P7qP37gGxHDVFf3fjbmw',1,1687774050,5.15,NULL,'13Ghf2T883ZobjngC1BAgR1BWvK2P7qP37gGxHDVFf3fjbmw',200,16137548,NULL,NULL,NULL,22100,3480490,25735,'[Please reject] Erroneous Referendum Submission','This is an erroneous referendum submission, please reject.'),(810,2,43,35277,5,1,33,0,'0xbc925f35a31fedb443cdeb8a56dd331dfcf571551e7b85fee7dbc5940f1b511d',43,100,16135572,'13Ghf2T883ZobjngC1BAgR1BWvK2P7qP37gGxHDVFf3fjbmw',1,1687776594,5.18,1690160352,'13Ghf2T883ZobjngC1BAgR1BWvK2P7qP37gGxHDVFf3fjbmw',200,16137972,1690246848,5.20,NULL,1736554,1140892,1103835,'Polkadot Relayers Incubator 2023','**Proponent:** Tribe/AngelHack 13Ghf2T883ZobjngC1BAgR1BWvK2P7qP37gGxHDVFf3fjbmw\n\n**Requested DOT:** USD$175,000 | 35,277.535 DOT\n\nWe are proposing to run the next iteration of the Polkadot Relayers for 2023, in collaboration with Astar, HydraDX, Interlay, OAK Network, Moonbeam, Zeitgeist and Unique Network.\n\nThe Polkadot Relayers is a community-first early-stage incubator programme that seeks to grow talented builders in their endeavour to build dApps on Polkadot’s parachains.

In our experience, this is the average funding that we require to provision, run, maintain, and monitor a basic service for each small network. Unused prorated amounts will be refunded at the end.\n-   Historic data has shown us that this should be sufficient to serve up to 5 million daily API responses with careful rate limiting and DDOS protection. \n-   For the few larger networks that exceed these requirements (e.g. Polkadot\'s RPC endpoint), those sovereign parachains will be responsible for all costs above the base $620 funding.\n-   We will also start working with other ecosystem infrastructure providers to work on a more sustainable long term solution\n\n## Background and Problem Statement\n\nAs Polkadot’s largest and most cost efficient infrastructure provider, since November 2020 we\'ve provided access to dedicated node support and free public API service for over 68 networks in the Polkadot / Kusama ecosystems. **We’ve always made it our goal to provide complete support for the entire Polkadot  ecosystem.** For RPC API services, historically we have sought funding from the sovereign parachain teams themselves for funding the ongoing operating expenses of these services. However, as the crypto winter has hit hard, many teams are no longer able to fund core public good services like public RPC endpoints.\n\nThis has a detrimental effect on applications that serve the Polkadot ecosystem (many of which are our customers). Wallets (e.g. Talisman and Nova), explorers (e.g. Subscan and Polkaholic), account tools (e.g. Sub.ID), indexers (e.g. Subsquid and SubQuery), governance applications (e.g. Polkassembly and Subsquare), and thousands of other applications in each ecosystem struggle to find reliable, performant, and SLA supported RPC API endpoints for many smaller networks.\n\n> “If we had some public good service that helps grass root teams it would be a tremendous help for teams such as ours” - Imbue\n\nThis is causing a divide in our ecosystem between highly funded parachains that can survive the winter, and new emergent chains that are struggling to get started - we’re seeing first hand that the number of growing new parachains in Polkadot is stalling.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n**We’re requesting globally accessible and equitable funding from the treasury to cover a basic RPC API service (full archive and trace node support included) for all active Polkadot and Kusama parachains to provide immediate relief until we can set up a *Parachain Infrastructure Bounty*.**\n\nThis proposal will cover US$620 of base funding each month for each parachain’s API service. To start with, we budget that there will be 38 parachains that take us up on this offer (all parachains with an active lease will be eligible). The total combined running cost for each month is estimated at USD $23,560.00 - all inclusive of capital and operating expenses, administration time from OnFinality DevOps, onboarding costs, backup costs, and all other monitoring and right-sizing by our team.\n\n**The initial proposal is for July\'s cost only**\n\n## Longer term solution\n\n> “Teams need to coordinate/negotiate with all sorts of partners (block explorers, rpc node providers, wallets, other parachains). This slows down innovation for Kusama.” - Interlay\n\nMultiple parachains have privately and publicly affirmed that one of the biggest challenges is dealing with all the tertiary providers needed to run a production parachain (RPC nodes, block explorers, indexers, governance pages, wallets integrations and more).\n\nWe propose that in the long term, we create a new “Parachain Infrastructure Bounty”, that provides basic public services for all active parachins for both ecosystems. The aim is to make the ecosystem more harmonious, unify processes and tools, speed up development progress, and will help all new teams get started.\n\nBut setting this bounty up and communicating with the large number of stakeholders will take a long time. At this stage, we expect at least 5 RPC providers, 4 wallets, 3 block explorers, 2 indexers, and 2 governance tools will want to be party to this bounty if it encompasses all “public good infrastructure”.\n\nAs a result, in order to establish precedent, and to provide quick pain relief to all parachains next week, our view is to proceed with the current immediate solution now. \n\n---\n\n[Please read the full proposal here including a collection of feedback and discussion from community members here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Sr8v7x81LvnZ62sW7zT3sWxEFTdfcQwfrElRbIGG0Q/edit?usp=sharing)'),(813,2,46,7915,5,1,32,0,'0xe0f255af490c334266a6c22d9c91cd8aa2997baacf9f3f936b74b263792bfe6e',42,100,16156959,'123LuJKS65HaBbLSdDS46ByeC7bvQwA1iUhTpmjigQAfUKpK',1,1687905312,5.12,NULL,'123LuJKS65HaBbLSdDS46ByeC7bvQwA1iUhTpmjigQAfUKpK',100,16159359,NULL,NULL,NULL,258648,3502905,141573,'Polkadot Hubs - Initiative case-study, education and support for future hubs (12 months period)','**Introduction**\n\nPolkadot hubs are community-operated spaces, where people who share their interest in the ecosystem meet and work together, learn from each other and organize events.

GovernGoofed wants to offer a solution to 3 of the most challenging aspects of **OpenGov1:** **participation, rewards, education.**\n\nThe requested amount for this proposal is symbolic.\n\nThis proposal has 3 goals:\n\n- Explain the scope of the GovernGoofed project.\n- Research the cost and ideal approach.\n- Attract contributors for the project.\n\n\n**Proposer**\n\nOkAlice, is a young dev agency that works and builds exclusively in the Polkadot ecosystem since mid 2022. Two out of four of our core team members will be enrolling in the next PBA in Berkeley next week. [@snow_mead](https://twitter.com/snow_mead) , [@DagieDee](https://twitter.com/DagieDee)\n\nOne core team member works at parity and has an advisory roll: [@kodeist](https://twitter.com/kodeist)\n\n\n> What is GovernGoofed?\n\n**Problem**\n\n- There’s a lack of participation in the governance and treasury proposals in the Dotsama ecosystem. \n- There’s no real incentive for Dot holders to vote on proposals \n- There’s often little knowledge about proposals\n\n**Solution**\n\n- Make the act of voting more visible and cool.\n- Incentivise voting with non-financial rewards, so people vote for the right reason.\n- Create a tool/community that explains the most important proposals in a non-technical way\n\n\n**How?**\n\nThe GovernGoofed solution consists out of 3 parts\n\n**PART 1: Making participation in voting visible and cool.**\n\nPart one of GovernGoofed is a Dapp where people can upload their favourite pfp. The Dapp is a goofmachine that then changes/goofes the pfp according to the amount of votes a user made. By this it leverages the existing NFT communities inside the Polkadot ecosystem to visualise the participation of their members in the Polkadot governance.\n\nHow? \n\nVoters can upload their favourite pfp to a Dapp. \nThe Dapp tracks and takes in to account the amount of votes and according to the votes it goofes -> changes the pfp. I.e. 10 votes ‘goofes’ the pfp slightly, 50 votes changes it more, 100 votes ‘goofes’ the pfp drastically. \nThe pfp’s are interpreted and changed by a trained AI. The AI uses re-occuring features that are recognizable in other goofed NFT’s.\n\n**PART 2: Incentivising voting**\n\nEach goofed NFT holders participates automatically in a raffle. The winners of the raffle are rewarded with benefits such as:\n\n- Being invited to a Polkadot Decoded event, flight & hotel costs are covered by the GovernGoofed treasury.\n- The winners can spend x amount of DOT supporting a Dotsama project such as [Teddie Dao](https://teddydao.org/) or any other project.\n- Other options to be explored\n\nSo in essence the benefits by voting will be real, but they increase the participation of the voters in the ecosystem rather than voters being financially rewarded.\n\n**PART 3: Educational**\n\nGovernGoofed is a media platform that educates about the current running proposals by giving a stage to proposers and voters. \nIt uses known channels such as YT, Twitter, Discord etc. to give a voice to proposers in order to give insight in their proposal.\n\nA full visual presentation of the project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13in-4Ww4zAkKsBrzbW9THkXEgBQLyM00Bwo3JDNb1oM/edit?usp=sharing).'),(819,2,52,3956,6,1,32,0,'0xf51f179bbd25cda5426d18144bd24ae6f6a06c1acfbf19d0d32b5c94feb2b06c',42,100,16208959,'15SN9iNKxCJJjQ5f6JXEDxiaS6bRHxxTZtsfm3wCSSjyoENg',1,1688217522,5.36,NULL,'15SN9iNKxCJJjQ5f6JXEDxiaS6bRHxxTZtsfm3wCSSjyoENg',100,16211359,NULL,NULL,NULL,495269,1593572,305083,'DAO_Terminal: Enhancing User Involvement in Polkadot Governance','DAO_Terminal: Enhancing User Involvement in Polkadot Governance.\n\nAI-generated, unbiased, easy-to-digest event summaries from Polkadot governance across channels like Twitter, Telegram, and Email.\n\n\n\n**Prototype**\nAlready ready to subscribe [https://twitter.com/PolkaTerminal](https://twitter.com/PolkaTerminal)\n\n[Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c06QW39w064QLSd2HajX3-Zt_2JnI6flE7GCSlSIG1w/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nGet presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vqDpMA8jGIR-Vecu0mj41yQv8MuiNaE4/view?usp=drive_link)! \n\n\n**Challenge**\n\n![](https://web3files.live/ipfs/QmeJWgvFtsgctnhxKmSsHPXY4BguhHdHSJZTpRpYaHPDBn/Slide3.jpeg)\n![](https://web3files.live/ipfs/QmeJWgvFtsgctnhxKmSsHPXY4BguhHdHSJZTpRpYaHPDBn/Slide4.jpeg)\n\n**Overview**\nDAO_Terminal is designed to streamline user engagement in Polkadot governance by delivering key event digests across user-preferred channels.

More details can be found below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problemstatement\">Problem statement</h2>\n<h3 id=\"background\">Background</h3>\n<p>While all blockchain systems support (at least in some sense) offline signing used in air-gapped wallets and lightweight embedded devices, only few allow simultaneously complex upgradeable logic and full message decoding on the cold off-line signer side; Substrate is one of these heartening few, and therefore - we should build on this feature to greatly improve transaction security, and thus in general, network resilience.</p>\n<p>As a starting point, it is important to recognise that prudence and due care are naturally required. As we build further reliance on this feature we should be very careful to make sure it works correctly every time so as not to create false sense of security.</p>\n<p>In order to enable decoding that is small and optimized for chain storage transactions, a metadata entity is used, which is not at all small in itself (on the order of half-MB for most networks). This is a dynamic data chunk which completely describes chain interfaces and properties that could be made into a portable scale-encoded string for any given network version and passed along into an off-chain device to familiarize it with latest network updates. Of course, compromising this metadata anywhere in the path could result in differences between what user sees and signs, thus it is essential that we protect it.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we have 2 problems to be solved:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Metadata is large, takes long time to be passed into a cold storage device.</li>\n<li>Metadata authenticity should be ensured.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As of now, there is no working solution for (1), as the whole metadata has to be passed to the device. On top of this, the solution for (2) heavily relies on a trusted party managing keys and ensuring metadata is indeed authentic: creating poorly decentralized points of potential failure.</p>\n<h4 id=\"asubstrateledgerappwhichisbothgenericandsecure\">A Substrate Ledger app which is both generic and secure</h4>\n<p>We propose a secure hardware wallet (Ledger) application that can automatically handle all parachains and relay chains without being affected by runtime upgrades. This has been requested by the community for a long time. The objective is to provide a single application for the entire ecosystem, with the flexibility to allow new functionality without compromising security.</p>\n<p>This is not a new problem and there have been strong attempts to solve it, however, it is apparent to us that in order to provide a secure solution that changes to the nodes themselves are required. This would provide the ecosystem with a resilient and secure, on-chain validated method which we believe the Polkadot ecosystem deserves.</p>\n<p>We want a secure by design solution that can clear sign and support most relay chains and parachains without the need of frequent updates.</p>\n<p>A solution should take into account that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Until now, metadata is not verifiable and must be considered <strong>not trusted.</strong></li>\n<li>Metadata changes breaking Ledger apps and other air gapped solutions.</li>\n<li>Substrate (used in Polkadot and all the Parachains) is a <strong>framework that evolves over time</strong>. This should not be constrained by artificial restrictions.</li>\n<li>The ecosystem requires a <strong>secure</strong> long term generic solution.</li>\n<li>A strong and long term solution requires the collaboration of multiple stakeholders, including Parity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is important to minimize application updates to reduce auditing costs.</li>\n<li>Ledger Nano S has only 4kB of RAM (Typically &lt;3kB are available to apps). Implementation is not trivial, a team with a strong reputation would be required (several years building a large amount of apps).</li>\n<li>There are aspects such as derivation paths that may require special treatment.</li>\n<li>Metadata may need to be extended with some minor additional fields.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"projectdetails\">Project details</h2>\n<h3 id=\"proposedsolution\">Proposed solution</h3>\n<h4 id=\"includemetadataintosignature\">Include metadata into signature</h4>\n<p>This is the simplest part - add some hash of metadata to signing inputs and sign. The size of data stored on chain does not change - except for a flag that would indicate whether this new feature is used or is data signed as before (so that cold signers could force \"with metadata always\" rule if they can or not force it if they cannot). This was discussed in github issues, now we suggest that the whole wallet/signer community comments on this part.</p>\n<h4 id=\"reducetransferredmetadatasize\">Reduce transferred metadata size</h4>\n<p>This is where things get tricky - and what would be addressed mostly within scope of this proposal. For small embedded devices like Kampela (64kBit internal RAM) and Ledger (4 kB RAM), shortening the metadata is essential. Only small part of metadata is really needed for decoding. The proposal by the Substrate team was to represent metadata hashes as Merkle tree and use it to securely and scalably generate the metadata validity proof on cold device.</p>\n<p>For this, metadata should be abbreviated in some deterministic manner, similar to what native <code>retain()</code> <a href=\"https://docs.rs/scale-info/latest/scale_info/struct.PortableRegistry.html#method.retain\">operation</a> from <code>scale-info</code> does, but more strictly. This procedure should have following properties:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be deterministic across implementations and platforms.</li>\n<li>Result in easily-merkelizeable data.</li>\n<li>Be associative - we should be able to reduce metadata sequentially for optimized caching strategies or go directly to minimal.</li>\n<li>Result in minimal size of metadata and require minimal RAM for its handling.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"implementationofasubstratesecuregenericappbyzondax\">Implementation of a Substrate secure generic app by Zondax</h4>\n<p>A more succinct version of the metadata is specified in collaboration with other teams. Existing Runtime metadata already describes pallets, extrinsics and other typical elements but some elements that are not relevant could be removed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Merkle tree is used to process this succinct metadata; generating a root hash but at the same time allows accessing individual elements (leaves) in a verifiable fashion.</li>\n<li>A new adapted version of Zondax&rsquo;s existing Ledger apps can parse blobs informed by verifiable metadata leaves (VML). Depending on the device capabilities a several VML are ingested as a batch or they are on-demand transferred to the device.</li>\n<li>Dynamic parsing is not trivial in embedded devices without dynamic memory. We have an internal prototype and we feel confident about it. Moreover, we have in the past already done something similar for another large project.</li>\n<li>A new extended signature mode is used. When signing, the digest is calculated, however, a kind of domain separation is used where the root of the Merkle tree is prefixed. Moreover, this root does not need to be included in the tx as it is common knowledge. During verification, the corresponding runtime can apply a similar mechanism.</li>\n<li>Other aspects such as chain name or params are also planned to be embedded as VML and handled automatically. This completely removes the requirement of an online registry and centralized repositories where entities need to submit parachain information and parameters without adequate identity verification.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"courseofaction\">Course of action</h3>\n<p>For this to succeed, a concerted effort from several teams is necessitated. Thus, this proposal is formulated and submitted jointly by several collaborativly aligned ecosystem teams and is closely coordinated in conjunction with the Substrate core development team.</p>\n<p>There are also potential alternatives to Merkle tree indexing of metadata (for example, <a href=\"https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-04-02-bilinear-accumulators-for-cryptocurrency/\">bilinear accumulators</a>) that offer certain advantages, like slower growth at large runtime size increases, which might be expected. We should analyze these approaches and try to determine their feasibility, and if they are indeed better choice, replace all Merkle tree propositions of this project with corresponding more optimal tools.</p>\n<h3 id=\"preliminarywork\">Preliminary work</h3>\n<p>We have carried out some <a href=\"https://github.com/Alzymologist/substrate-parser/blob/main/examples/main.rs\">minimal analysis</a> in advance of publishing this proposal in an initial effort to reliably shorten metadata using basic tools. The first attempt resulted in reduction from about 200kB to about 8kB with some outdated snapshot of metadata - modern result should look even more impressive as while metadata grew significantly, the individual call-related data substructures sizes changed little.</p>\n<p>This demonstration is, however, far from refined solution. Decomposing certain calls would still result in enormous data structures (namely, popular <code>batch_call</code> instruction would require an enum with all other calls and their parameters included). Furthermore, even 8kB significantly too large for typical secure element RAM limitations. Thus, serious additional research is required to formulate the final standard.</p>\n<p>With regards to the implementation of the Ledger app, the proposed solution is a progression on the current solution Zondax provides. Zondax has been involved in related works in other ecosystems but this approach is state-of-the-art in comparison to what others have been doing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ecosystemfit\">Ecosystem fit</h2>\n<p>Once defined and implemented in Substrate core, this feature would be available for all Substrate-based chains, across whole ecosystem. Any wallet or key management device would be able to implement it with use of documentation and libraries delivered within the scope of this project. Offline device security and useability would improve significantly, which would also increase their use in the community. All of this would culminate in a materially enhanced ecosystem resilience and remove severe UX issues that inhibit Polkadot ecosystem adoption.</p>\n<p>As shown above, there is significant amount of attention from various ecosystem players to this project; we are closely working with community and relevant teams to make this happen for some time already.</p>\n<p>Deliveries of this project are a blocker for proper fulfillment of <a href=\"../treasury/266\">Milestone 5 for Kampela project</a>, where transaction protocol specification should be defined. Sending whole metadata over NFC would take noticeable amount of time thus making UX uncomfortable enough to severely reduce adoption of device. If this project gains community support and passes, only a small delay in Kampela development would be present as the NFC transfer protocol specification would follow soon after this project\'s standard is published.</p>\n<p>This solution would enable teams to keep innovating and developing new features. This would benefit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relay chain</li>\n<li>Parachains</li>\n<li>Current and future users</li>\n<li>Overall network security</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"roadmapanddeliverymilestones\">Roadmap and delivery milestones</h1>\n<p>After each milestone, a brief summary report of progress will be submitted for the community to review.</p>\n<p><strong>Milestone 1</strong> - Requirements specifications and latest metadata review (2 weeks)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publish refined requirements for protocol, aligned with existing offline devices capabilities, current state of metadata, and runtime implementation requirements</li>\n<li>Publish first draft of mock shortened metadata for parallel development</li>\n<li>Estimate shortened metadata size frames based on information theory</li>\n<li>Coordination with all stakeholders on a working Group for Verifiable Metadata Spec</li>\n<li>Analyze alternative hashing/storage strategies to Merkle tree, to potentially replace the latter in following steps with a more optimal solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone 2</strong> - Offline metadata prototype (6 weeks)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic algorithm to generate a shortened metadata and associated Merkle tree as proof-of-concept code example</li>\n<li>Refined draft for mock shortened metadata</li>\n<li>Feasibility analysis and possible caveats/solutions for offline devices implementations</li>\n<li>Early implementation of a generic app with metadata support</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone 3</strong> - Offline metadata specifications (8 weeks)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exhaustive documentation on new protocol</li>\n<li><code>substrate-parser</code> reference implementation</li>\n<li>Ledger App integration tests and javascript library</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Milestone 4</strong> - Offline devices implementation (8 weeks)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement offline metadata in Kampela device</li>\n<li>Implemention with final offline metadata spec in Ledger device</li>\n<li>External security audit of the Ledger App</li>\n<li>At least propose solution package for Polkadot Vault app</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"requiredrolesandassociatedcosts\">Required roles and associated costs</h2>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

If this happens, the whole initiative fails.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this, we have ensured that Substrate core developers are interested in this improvement and, furthermore, are ready to review it and include it in forthcoming Substrate updates. See <a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/10478\">above</a> <a href=\"https://forum.polkadot.network/t/the-ledger-app-debate-united-we-stand-divided-we-fall/3177/19\">communications</a> for details of these negotiations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ledgerauditapproval\">Ledger audit/approval</h2>\n<p>Review Process: Ledger&rsquo;s review queue is sometimes unpredictable and depends on Ledger\'s workload and other factors that are out of Zondax control. We have experience in their process and have a streamlined workflow to simplify this. However, the effective time may vary depending on Ledger\'s resource availability, app/blockchain complexity, etc. The review process does not imply Ledger Live integration and is typically limited to the publication of the app in the Ledger Live Store allowing final users to install directly from Ledger.</p>\n<p>To mitigate these risks, an external audit, will be coordinated and any relevant fixes will be applied. The external auditor will be selected from a list provided by Ledger SAS. Ledger SAS claims and it is public knowledge that when provided with a satisfactory auditor report from an auditor in that list, apps will be published in a much shorter period of time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fundamentallimitations\">Fundamental limitations</h2>\n<p>There is a slim chance that metadata could not be reduced to size manageable within given space limitation (worst case is Ledger device), or that it could not be reduced to that size in general but could in some cases. This would limit usability of low-memory devices for Substrate-based networks to some extent; we see this probability as very slim and in worst reasonably-probable scenario we see that limitations would be minor, like limit on number of calls in a batch. This kind of limitations would marginally degrade user experience and would not harm security, so this risk seems acceptable. Future models of secure elements with larger memory spaces would probably come to market in near future to bring further relief to these limitations.</p>\n<h1 id=\"futureplans\">Future plans</h1>\n<p>After delivering the last milestone, we plan to maintain the project and spread its implementation into the whole ecosystem where its usage is relevant.

While this will not be easy to accomplish, it is a worthwhile endeavor that will benefit Polkadot both short and long term.\n\nExisting Polkadot iPhone developers mostly focus on wallets. New developers that want to build for Polkadot must pick apart wallet code to build anything. The Finsig SDK makes it easier for iPhone developers to build any type of app and creates a level playing field for innovation.\n\nThe design of the Finsig SDK focuses on RPC and light client based apps that will pass the scrutiny of the App Store publishing process.\n\nFunding for the Finsig SDK is aligned with the interests of Polkadot. Finsig performed six months of full-time effort up front. Funding is being requested for the next three months of full-time effort.

The bounty itself is already proposed on-chain and approved once. However, the approval of the bounty has to be initiated again, even though the community has already approved it via previous governance. This means we would still have to ensure that the new referendum gets sufficient approval and support to enact and bounty to get funding.\n\n[Here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/101) is the referendum approved but failed to execute.\n\n[Here](https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/14834973?tab=event&event=14834973-0) is the error message we got on-chain.\n\n[Here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1491) is the previous community discussion on Polkassembly.\n\n# TLDR;\nThis bounty aims to nurture and develop WebAssembly smart contracts on parachains. As Gavin mentioned in this CoinDesk article, WebAssembly is the future of smart contracts. However, even in the Polkadot ecosystem, EVM smart contract is the go-to-market solution now simply because lack of ecosystem toolings and dApps new developers can refer to. To bootstrap the Wasm dApps in the ecosystem, we will fund canary dApps and toolings through this bounty.\n\n### Context of This Bounty\nPlease see this post first. Currently, based on the data, smart contract Parachains are leading the Polkadot ecosystem in terms of market adoption. More projects are deploying dApps on Polkadot Parachains than making Parachains today and this trend will likely continue due to the high resource requirement to deploy a chain. The core problem is that the Polkadot ecosystem only supports EVM at the time of writing this and we are reproducing something which other L1s/L2s can do. One of Polkadot’s main differentiators and default environments is Wasm. In this bounty, we would like to push Wasm smart contracts adoption. The scope is as follows:\n\n- Create easily accessible and audited ink!/ask! smart contract showcases\n- Create ink!ubator - an incubation program to support community projects built with ink! and parachains that want to expose select APIs through contracts-pallet “chain extensions”. We will also help facilitate a smart contract auditing market.\n- Develop a React hooks library “useInk” - the missing front-end library for Dapps on Polkadot.\n\n# Bounty Proposal\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2QECPsXQktVGZIat_yNKTlodviTecMZ6IbiLNQ4NLM/edit) is the full bounty proposal.\n\n# Curators Candidates\n**Sam Ruberti from Parity Technologies (Address: 13zqqP37p8HjLuWr7sha9GcAcYiiDgjqoNS3YbSELtgvaAfb):**\nSam Ruberti is a Senior Rust Developer with ink! and has over twelve years of experience delivering full-stack products for companies including Bloomberg, Peloton, and Clear, and five years of experience building full-stack Dapps in production environments.

this Proposal, the Apillon platform would transition to an open-source infrastructure solution with permanent freemium access, governed by the community, and thus become a common good project, further spurring Web3 adoption, Polkadot ecosystem growth, and DOT utility.\n\nApillon [(apillon.io)](http://www.apillon.io) is a Web3 development platform ([app.apillon.io](http://app.apillon.io)) empowering developers to easily build dapps and other Web3 products in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*Kf4rg1crJ13CDOQHpcVWKw.png)\n\nCurrently, the platform provides the functionality of dashboard-based deployment of Web3 services and API connectivity - the parachains’ functionalities are abstracted and translated into ready-to-use, few-click Web3 services that can be combined to power multi-chain Web3 projects.\n\nThrough DOT-based open governance by the Apillon community, the platform would undergo future upgrades, including integrations of voted parachain and other services, to best respond to users\' needs and deliver user-oriented opportunities for Web3 adoption.\n\n> **The updates to the Proposal are as follows:**\n- Proposal format changes from Treasury to Bounty to align with OpenGov funding schemes and give more control to the governance and treasury community, as a direct answer to raised concerns in the public discussion phase.\n- The total funding amount changes slightly to compensate for the DOT price volatility and treasury track placement.\n\n\n![](https://ipfs.apillon.io/ipfs/QmTdJ426x3tpPBmygbafryS4kgqtJu6HtsHQGTBZg8GjCP)\n\nWe want to make the concept of Apillon’s Treasury Proposal as comprehensive and transparent as possible. We will do our best to provide additional explanation and information you might request.\n\n**Payout structure**\n\n![](https://ipfs.apillon.io/ipfs/QmYKZYp1Z9mrRrVY374aafMx9K2mg8ELYx8nVxXk6hudMo)\n\nAdditional links:\n\n* [The full Apillon Proposal](https://ipfs.apillon.io/ipfs/QmZmZLdpeuVN9vpw3WNzJh8F62vzqwZDmrXdh5mBRB1GVh)\n* [The Apillon platform Quick Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQJnuvUo-xo)\n* [The official Apillon Proposal announcement](https://blog.apillon.io/apillon-aims-to-foster-web3-adoption-as-a-common-good-infrastructure-solution-on-polkadot-6566508190c5)\n\n- [The AAG on Polkadot and Kusama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuE-zxEsOAk) \n\nPlease post any questions, concerns, or feedback in one of the following ways:\n\n* In the comments section below\n* In the Polkadot Forum comment section (informal)\n* In the Polkadot Direction Element channel comments section (informal)'),(841,2,82,12455,1,1,33,0,'0xd5c9c9a130d86d06be3d7ad359c2c9edc0b4739d680e7a61515d27a19b2c4293',42,100,16447708,'12mRyiCp9zdh1wEVW5gLLiFBxDPKks72rRXmSupyEK3VAMLf',1,1689651174,5.36,1691751960,'12mRyiCp9zdh1wEVW5gLLiFBxDPKks72rRXmSupyEK3VAMLf',200,16450108,1691838660,5.03,NULL,7574005,5083003,3348997,'OnFinality High Performance Public Infrastructure (Q2 2023)','**Proposer:** [OnFinality ](https://onfinality.io/)is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot/Substrate community.

These services have the following three outcomes:\n\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes, and to allow development teams to focus on innovation rather than running infrastructure\n\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing more stable infrastructure services that can be depended on to scale\n\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how nodes are running, what calls are causing errors, and where traffic is originating from\n\nBackground on our RPC Service\n=============================\n\nSince inception in November 2020 we have made a large number of improvements to our Ultimate API service focussing on three key areas; performance/reliability, providing more value from our Ultimate API service, and cost optimisation.\n\n### Performance/Reliability\n\nOnFinality is operationally striving for a minimum of 99.99% reliability, which means less than an hour of downtime each year.  We proudly display and share our [90 day uptime statistics](https://status.onfinality.io/) for each network publicly [here](https://status.onfinality.io/uptime/r40wwpclbwzm).\n\nWe have invested hugely into a team dedicated to optimising our application gateway and caching layer to ensure that we provide the fastest possible service for our customers. We run clusters in 5 different regions (North Virginia, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Singapore, and Australia) and across 3 different cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Alicloud) to ensure that we are fault tolerant to any single region or cloud provider ceasing service.\n\n### Providing more value from our Ultimate API service\n\nFor customers that do sign up for paid API keys, we\'ve been adding more and more features to provide a better experience. [Geolocation insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-adds-geolocation-insights-for-dapps-and-api-apps/) provide statistics about where in the world communities are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives.  We can also now [automatically upsize the storage on nodes](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-developer-update-auto-expand-storage-for-dedicated-nodes/) to prevent the risk of any downtime.\n\nFinally, in Q2 of 2023 OnFinality [launched Trace API](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-trace-api-for-unprecedented-visibility-into-your-dapps/) support which was a huge enhancement allowing unprecedented visibility for dApp builders. Trace API captures and records vital information otherwise not available through regular RPC methods and extrinsics (such as complete XCM transfer records and complete list of balance changes). These APIs are essential in order for [developers like Polkaholic](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinalitys-new-trace-api-helping-colorful-notion-get-trace-data-from-over-40-substrate-chains/) to parse and understand XCM transactions.\n\n### Cost Optimisation\n\nOnFinality is very conscious about providing a strong level of support for Polkadot/Kusama at an extremely competitive price. Cost saving measurement has been a significant focus on behalf of our customers, with advanced rate limiting controls implemented. We can, for example, rate limit each client on a burst and sustained basis and based on the request methods that they are calling (e.g. each state_traceBlock request is rate limited 45x more than chain_getBlock), [read more about these advanced rate limiting tools that we\'ve developed here](https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/public-rate-limits).\n\nMeaning that we can continue to provide generous public API endpoints for over 40 different networks for common-good applications, but restrict access to high volume users that abuse this free service. We\'ve been able to manage our costs significantly on behalf of our customers as a result. \n\nWe\'ve [developed and shared our approach towards service sustainability](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1270), with the introduction of a \'Paid API Revenue Share Discount\' scheme. In this scheme OnFinality pools the revenue from customers that pay for higher API pricing plans and distributes this revenue pool to partners that currently pay for and own each API endpoint proportionally based on the number of paid API requests that go to that API endpoint. The scheme was introduced in Q1 of 2023 and resulted in a discount to [Polkadot\'s Q1 treasury proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/287) of $396.90.\n\nOur cost optimisation efforts were validated in Q1 as we had the lowest cost per million responses across all of the major RPC providers that lodged a proposal to the Polkadot treasury. You can see how our costs compared to other RPC providers in the ecosystem during Q1 [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Utw2HfS7I5Gpyhrl9ejuj0CrQ4AcChGFteXdw0a8tro/edit#gid=0).\n\nService Details\n===============\n\nDuring Q2 of 2023, we\'ve made a number of new improvements to our Ultimate API service that address performance/reliability, features, and costs.\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n-   [Launched Trace API](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-trace-api-for-unprecedented-visibility-into-your-dapps/) allowing unprecedented visibility for dApp builders.

OnFinality is a new one stop shop for all of your RPC needs from multiple ecosystems.\n\n-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.\n\n-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to any  substrate team\n\nOur customers are building cross-chain wallets, running some of the largest block explorers, and are indexing multiple networks - they\'ve all benefited from these API access restrictions, improved monitoring, and the larger number of supported Polkadot chains.

To access the entire user base, application teams need to integrate with up to 80 separate networks, each potentially implementing similar functionality in different ways.\n\nThis leads to an increasing complexity for developers who build in the Polkadot ecosystem, where breadth of support is paramount to enjoying the network effect benefits that the parachain system brings. They are slowed down by the need to understand, implement and index the required data across parachains, each team reinventing the wheel and individually bearing the full infrastructure costs. \n\nFor example, tracking transactions and NFTs across the Polkadot and Kusama space are fragmented across a growing matrix of:\n- 80 + Networks\n- 2+ token transaction implementations\n- 6+ NFT Implementations and standards\n\nAs a whole for the ecosystem this is highly inefficient and slows growth, and R&D cycles are slow as teams must invest heavily before being able to test their product with users. It puts Polkadot and its teams at a competitive disadvantage over larger networks which closely follow standards, such as EVM, and already have extensive tooling including Unified APIs for their community.\n\n## Proposed Solution (Unified NFT API)\n\n**OnFinality is building a suite of fast and reliable Multi-Chain Unified APIs for the Polkadot ecosystem to help overcome the integration complexity that comes with 80+ parachains. These new Multi-Chain Unified APIs will  include (among other things) transactions, staking, balances, and in this case, NFTs.**\n\nThis model is well received in other ecosystems, where there is a proven value to multi-chain standardised use case APIs. \n\n**It will be Polkadot’s first reliable, scalable, and complete NFT API.**\n\n## Open-Source Multi-Chain NFT Indexing project\n\nOnFinality’s Unified NFT API will provide access to NFTs and their metadata for all popular standards across the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems and beyond, in a single, simple request. The OnFinality NFT API will just be the first Unified API offered by OnFinality, with plans to expand to transactions, staking, and more.\n\nWe envisage that this project will support the following standards over the long term\n\n- EVM ERC-721 & 1155\n- WASM PSP34\n- Substrate Uniques standard\n- Substrate NFTs standard\n- ormlNFTs\n\nOpen-sourcing this project allows developers who prefer to run their own infrastructure to get value out of this proposal. The project code for the first milestone is here https://github.com/OnFinality-io/api-nft/tree/main and is open sourced under the GPLv3 licence.\n\nThis project indexes data to allow the following key use cases (but not limited to):\n\n- Get all NFTs for a wallet address across all parachains\n- Get an NFT’s current owner\n- Retrieve all NFTs for a collection\n- Retrieve the metadata for an NFT\n- Retrieve all transactions for an NFT\n- Retrieve all NFT transactions for a wallet address\n\nThis also removes the need for applications to load the metadata after retrieving an NFT, an often slow and complicated process.\n\n## Hosted Unified NFT API\n\nOnFinality takes the above open-source NFT indexing project, and hosts a production level high performance public GraphQL endpoint available completely free to the community - up to reasonable rate limits. \n\nThis endpoint will be operated with a target uptime of 99.9% allowing wallets and other production applications to utilise this (OnFinality has a proven track record as the largest and most reliable infrastructure provider in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems). We will publicly share all daily response counts and uptime status of each Unified API.\n\nGraphQL was chosen for its high flexibility compared to a REST or RPC endpoint, and was specifically requested by teams who provided feedback on this proposal. This common GraphQL API interface can be implemented and extended by each developer to make integration into various dApps or wallet applications easier and faster. \n\n## Feedback from ecosystem participants\n\nThe OnFinality Unified NFT API has been 100% led and validated by the most successful application teams in Polkadot.\n\n> *\"The need for accurate, real-time multi-chain information is a top priority for our users. Dealing with the complexities of querying various chains and NFT standards is proving to be a performance hindrance, especially as the number of NFTs owned increases. OnFinality’s Unified NFT API solution comes as a game-changing opportunity for us to streamline our processes, saving us valuable development time while ensuring optimal performance.\"* - Talisman (Wallet)\n\n> *\"Even though we have support for displaying Nodle NFTs in our mobile app and web client, Polkadot is an evolving network and it becomes more complex with each added chain. The Unified NFT API provides support for all NFT assets, regardless of where they\'re hosted: enhancing discoverability across the ever-expanding network of parachains.\"* - Nodle (Polkadot Parachain)\n\n> *“OnFinality’s Unified NFT API simplifies the development of NFT apps, significantly reducing barriers of entry. This not only fosters the growth of RMRK, but also sparks widespread usage and adoption of all types of NFTs across the Polkadot ecosystem.”* - RMRK (NFT Standard)\n\n> *“During our dilemma of building our own blockchain indexer, or trying to find any service out there for a few weeks, we found out about the Unified NFT API (beta), we tested it out on their playground and using Apollo client. It was a great developer experience. There is a genuine need for the product in the Dotsama space, this will push adoption and growth for the whole ecosystem undoubtedly. We are patiently waiting for the production release.”* - Development Team, Dotsama NFT Marketplace\n\nExamples of benefiting teams include\n\n- **Wallets** need to show a user their NFTs across the entire Polkadot ecosystem\n- **NFT Marketplaces** wishing to expand their support to more networks\n- **Scanners** will benefit from richer data such as NFT Name and Description which aren’t available on chain.\n- **Data analytics providers** will benefit from a off the shelf API that will allow them to expose Polkadot’s NFT ecosystem to a larger audience\n\n**View the complete proposal, as well as detailed milestones and costings for this proposal, here:** \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1OvTGlRHnd4y3vQsr3_Xq-CfId2SycDDcKwiN5p5zJoc/edit?usp=sharing\n\n'),(848,2,90,63916,6,1,33,0,'0xe46336f06567bd4ea7946211f3416ab1f4c98ff204c066400394995570fc3948',43,100,16639920,'14dut6zGgdVmKijePZzrQAy2gZ6FmMDmzzp7VqjzPV9E4ujR',1,1690805382,5.16,1692713250,'14dut6zGgdVmKijePZzrQAy2gZ6FmMDmzzp7VqjzPV9E4ujR',200,16642320,1692799692,4.43,NULL,7908415,5973479,5475922,'Gosemble Phase 2 - a Framework for building Substrate-compatible Runtimes in Go (Parachains & Solochains)','Hi everyone,\n\nMy name is Chris Veselinov, CTO of LimeChain, and I’m writing this thread to propose the phase 2 development and funding of [Gosemble](https://limechain.github.io/gosemble/) - a Framework for building Substrate-compatible Runtimes in Go.\n\nThe development of phase 1 was funded with [Motion 292](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/292) and successfully delivered with more details in [the treasury report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExVDjj4xQm4OYLkvVoiHjx_NzEFaL3gj/edit) and [this article](https://limechain.tech/blog/gosemble-empowering-polkadot-parachains-development/).\n\nAs mentioned in the previous proposal, the only current option for developing runtimes is Substrate. We believe this lack of diversity inhibits the decentralization ethos that is inherent to blockchain technology. Additionally, Rust, the language in which Substrate is written, is known for its steep learning curve.\n\nWe are excited about Phase 2, as modularising the codebase and developing additional modules will enhance progress and allow for an alternative framework to Substrate in Go. This will increase developers adoption by making it more accessible to the broader Go development community and contribute to the decentralization and security of the protocol.\n\nWe’ve also outlined the value proposition of Gosemble in a document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gD_ImtmY-eOdNQ08vdYwqbh2-X5xXleur1WvvMQDoR4/edit). \n\nTo sum it up: There are two main reasons why we’re building Gosemble:\n- Firstly, we lower the barrier to entry for developers and empower developers proficient in Go to build runtimes. \n- Secondly, we contribute to the technical decentralization of the protocol. This means that Gosemble provides a viable alternative to the Substrate runtime and lessens the reliance on Parity as a software development company building the Polkadot infrastructure. In addition to that, our work on Gosemble is valuable for finding faults in the Substrate runtime, other runtime and host implementations, as well as the Polkadot spec itself.\n\nFor more details, including technical milestones, check out the [proposal document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14kJvpqNxh1pe_wbGKbJA1XcsesOF_agd/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113946912904115479410&rtpof=true&sd=true)'),(849,2,93,36686,6,1,33,0,'0x66943c801e949b207a3cae643ab6190fb05cce92dfeca8fab54c494705037dc2',43,10,16656535,'15VmrRmgPhKMfBanjS5ei4dCcVL54GMLCfnVRryynSYzvyys',1,1690905198,5.08,1693076070,'15VmrRmgPhKMfBanjS5ei4dCcVL54GMLCfnVRryynSYzvyys',200,16658935,1693162512,4.48,NULL,7725902,1202432,2696165,'Infrastructure Funding for Polkadot Asset Hub - Migration of Kusama NFTs','# [➡️ Full proposal ⬅️ ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nSmVPlzmgD-sRvhaqFcyWLkwVMuOtpFx0a1wgfsPETo/edit?usp=sharing)\n# Summary of Proposal: Infrastructure Funding for Polkadot Asset Hub - Migration of Kusama NFTs\n\n## The Background\n\nThis proposal represents a strategic opportunity to migrate NFTs to Polkadot Asset Hub from Kusama Relay chain.\n\nWith 34,176 $KSM in total value locked in NFT sales and highly engaged users, Kusama has tremendous creative energy ready to expand Polkadot\'s reach.\n\nMigrating these diverse high-value NFT collections, comprising 2,847 total collections, 23,529 unique owners, and 37,438 $KSM in total volume will attract artists, collectors and capital - priming Polkadot for the upcoming NFT bull run. Facilitating the secure transfer of assets to Polkadot Asset Hub will provide continuity for existing Kusama NFT creators and owners during this platform transition.\n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/bjVrDtz\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/wZqKjtM/milestones2.png\" alt=\"milestones2\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n## Who will deliver this?\n\nKodaDot has unrivaled [expertise](https://hello.kodadot.xyz/about-us/who-are-we) in Substrate, NFTs and community growth specifically tailored to Kusama and Polkadot.\n\nOur open-source tools already empower NFT creators and traders on both networks. \n\nWith skilled leadership, talented developers and an engaged community, we are uniquely equipped to handle this complex transition smoothly.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nKusama\'s NFT ecosystem needs to migrate from the aging \"graffiti\" implementation to the new Polkadot Asset Hub. This poses challenges:\n\n- Preserving intricate NFT data like metadata, histories and ownership\n\n- No simple, reliable method for Kusama NFT owners to transfer assets\n\n- Platform change risks fracturing the thriving NFT community\n\n- No turnkey solution for mass migration while guaranteeing accuracy and security\n\nIn summary, the problem is executing safe, seamless migration without compromising asset provenance or community stability.\n\n## What\'s in it for Stakeholders\n\n- Polkadot Ecosystem: Readies ecosystem for NFT bull run by integrating Kusama NFTs and liquidity\n\n- Validators: Expected increase in transactions provides more validation opportunities\n\n- NFT Community: Benefits from more robust Polkadot Asset Hub and enhanced interoperability to expand reach \n\nOnboarding Kusama NFT value and users can significantly expand Polkadot\'s utility and audience.\n\n## The Plan\n\nKodaDot will develop robust, specialized tools to:\n\n- Securely transfer NFT metadata, provenance and ownership records\n\n- Map collections from Kusama into identical ones on Polkadot\n\n- Copy user-owned NFTs into new collections \n\n- Confirm transferred ownership rights\n\n- Store data securely to prevent loss\n\nOur solution will minimize disruption and maximize continuity for the Kusama NFT ecosystem migrating to Polkadot.\n\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/tXsNt0d\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/C27XZjr/2023-07-25-16-50-29.png\" alt=\"2023-07-25-16-50-29\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n## Milestones\n\nMilestones 1-3 as outlined below have already been completed.

Our system would ascertain baseline behavior and then auto-detect any changes that deviate from it in order to assess whether a warning signal is warranted. Once the system would identify real issues, we would create an early warning system that would flag the issues as they start occurring to those in the Polkadot network. This following document contains the background, rationale and development steps elaborating on reaching we will conduct in order to develop the PoC machine learning tool.\n\nProject Team\nWe have a distributed team of frontend and backend developers along with a project manager.

As outlined in our [Milestone 1 and 2 report](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/232#r86qRZjawwaL5113MjzU), by the end of those two milestones we had collected key feedback from developers and parachain/project teams, and created the challenges to get developers building on them in the EasyA app! \n\nIn this milestone, we held two spectacular hackathons at [Harvard University](https://twitter.com/easya_app/status/1670132876711723008) (in Boston, USA) and in [London](https://twitter.com/easya_app/status/1672712646230003714) (UK) which attracted top developers both from within the Polkadot ecosystem and beyond, with Web3 enthusiasts keen to learn more about Polkadot attending and hacking.\n\n![Absolutely packed auditoriums at the hackathons, with hackers hard at work learning about Polkadot, parachains and more! ](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642ed403044d8378fabb82a6/64afd59491b959274f7cd159_polkadot%20hackathon.jpg)\n\nOur #60DaysOfPolkadot campaign (which we’re continuing to run) has to-date brought over 30,000 developers to build in the Polkadot ecosystem via the EasyA in-app crash course. The sheer number of builders meant we were in the fortunate position to be able to select the very best developers to attend our two IRL hackathons. As a result, at the hackathons we had founders backed by a16z and YC, with multiple previous exits under their belts, as well as professional software engineers all coming together to create some of the best projects we’ve ever seen. In addition, we had a strong focus on students too, who came from nearby Harvard, MIT, Yale and Brown, and even as far away as from UChicago, Georgia Tech and Stanford. These students are the key to unlocking the next generation of Web3 builders, and they were inspired by the opportunities unlocked by Polkadot. Many of these brilliant teams are continuing to build on Polkadot after the hackathon.\n\nWhat did it look like in numbers? In summary:\n\n**Polkadot x EasyA Hackathon at Harvard (17-18 June, 2023):**\n\n1. Hackers: 300\n2. Final projects created: 35\n3. Colleges/companies represented: 45\n4.

Hackers: 250\n2. Final projects created: 36\n3. Colleges/companies represented: 38\n4. Social media impressions: 1M+\n\nWant to see the lines for the hackathon that stretched all the way down the road? Here’s the wrap-up video for the London hackathon [here](https://youtu.be/fNH5SAN95UM)!\n\nAt both hackathons, participants attended world-leading workshops held by Polkadot experts such as [Kevin Neilson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinneilson/) (Developer Relations at Moonbeam), [Dave Bean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davebean51/) (COO of Gear), and [Kahori Razzell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kahori-razzell-8213634b/) (UX at Astar). They received 24/7 support, both at a code-level and also in preparing for their presentations at the final round of selection!\n\nWe were keen to involve as much of the ecosystem as possible, so in addition to the Polkadot parachains and projects whom we got developers building on around the world via the EasyA app, we also had the pleasure of hosting Moonbeam, Gear and Astar in-person. Each of them held their own track at the hackathons too, which was a massive success; this enabled developers to see the strength of the Polkadot ecosystem in-person as well as the vibrant technologies they could leverage beyond just the Polkadot relay chain itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the excitement created about Polkadot by these two hackathons was incredible. We put a huge amount of effort into encouraging developers to continue building in the Polkadot ecosystem after the hackathon, and are currently supporting several teams with making connections within the ecosystem so that they can thrive (e.g. get technical expertise, know-how and funding)! This will ensure these two hackathons support the long-term growth of the Polkadot ecosystem!\n\n\n**Full Progress Report**\n\nIf you want to dive into the details of the hackathons, we’ve put everything together into this full report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dpy4e9JqiFiWaljAb_TttDF8JSzUEvgxl7BwuprrXkU/edit?usp=sharing)!\n\nThis includes the projects, budget allocation, pictures and everything else! \n\n\n**Milestone 3 Requested Allocation Breakdown Summary**\n\nDemonstrating EasyA’s commitment to the Polkadot ecosystem and respect for treasury spending that fully benefits the community, we have already paid for the costs of hosting these two hackathons ourselves; this was required for them to go ahead as scheduled and to create hype amongst builders in the run-up to Polkadot Decoded.\n\nNow that the community has had time to review and discuss our proposal in our discussion post which we posted up three weeks ago [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1846), we are now making this treasury proposal to request reimbursement for our costs in holding the two hackathons of $220,000.* As EasyA have already paid for the costs of the hackathons, this is a request for reimbursement, in accordance with the community’s wishes for proposals to achieve their goals first and request reimbursement retrospectively.\n\n*DOT amount calculated via EMA7 on 8 Aug 2023 at GMT+0 0700hrs: 1 DOT ~ USD$5.009. USD$220,000 ~ 43,920.94 DOT.\n\nDetails for this milestone were discussed in our original discussion post [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1585), with the precise milestone and allocation breakdown [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyip_eVdevsjijQQSkL_GPOE5YF-AEGgE_xhwCFLnt0/edit#bookmark=id.x3kscjjklocs).

This is highly inefficient and relieving the relay chain of this burden will not only allow for higher Parachain messaging throughput, but also parachain better scalability with async backing on the horizon.\n\n- HRMP (The current transport protocol), necessitates the intervention of governance to establish communication channels between related chains. While this ensures a certain level of security and verification, it also adds a layer of complexity and time consumption. We believe parachain interoperability should be the juridisction of the governance of the parachains involved, not the relay chain.\n\n- For chains to effectively interoperate with each other they must be able to read the state of that counterparty chain. This approach to interoperability are currently open & unasnwered questions today in the ecosystem: [Support custom storage proof from the relay-chain](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/issues/320), [META: Parachains Reading Storage of One Another](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5087)\n\n## Solution\n\nISMP (Interoperable State Machine Protocol) is designed to improve and secure cross-chain communication and operations by facilitating \"GET-like\" and \"POST-like\" requests between all substrate based chains under the security of the Polkadot Relay chain. By leveraging state proofs, it relieves the relay chain of the burden of message passing, contributing significantly to the scalability of parachains. It’s GET-like request protocol facilitates for the first time in the ecosystem [state reads of sibling parachains](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5087), [as well as the relay chain](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/issues/320), unlocking [new](https://twitter.com/ingoruebe/status/1684218666286473216?s=20) [kinds](https://twitter.com/XCAstronaut/status/1684275154334126080?s=20) of [applications](https://twitter.com/lolmcshizz/status/1686363770740752384?s=20).\n\nInspired by HTTP, aiming to become a similar standard for interoperability in the multi-chain environment.

This messaging is powered by an offchain relayer implementation, engineered to be chain-agnostic and extensible to multiple ecosystems. \n\n\nThis proposal is for a retroactive payment by Polkadot Treasury to cover development costs incurred.

Inspired by some of the best multisig wallets available in the Ethereum ecosystem, we have created a product that offers a comprehensive set of tools and features to ensure the safe and efficient management of your assets on the Polkadot network.\n\n**Why did we build Polkasafe?**\nEffective treasury management is essential for ensuring the financial stability and sustainability of any organization, fostering enhanced operational transparency, and facilitating prudent fund management with significantly diminished risk. The emergence of cryptocurrencies has catalyzed the evolution of an innovative, alternative financial ecosystem, distinct from traditional systems that have historically underserved a considerable segment of the global population.\nOrganizations today often utilize multiple cryptocurrencies for conducting transactions, both inbound and outbound. However, they currently face a dearth of sophisticated tools that empower them to efficiently manage their treasuries across various chains and multisig wallets. This challenge necessitates the development of innovative, practical solutions that coalesce disparate books spanning multiple blockchain networks and wallets into a unified organizational system.\nPolkaSafe endeavors to address this critical need by offering organizations a comprehensive suite of advanced, user-friendly solutions that harmonize their treasury management processes across multiple chains, including Polkadot, Kusama, and their respective parachains. By amalgamating diverse blockchain networks and multisig wallets into a singular, cohesive platform, PolkaSafe paves the way for a more streamlined, efficient, and secure approach to digital asset management, thereby empowering organizations to navigate the complexities of the rapidly evolving crypto-financial landscape with confidence and dexterity.\n\n**Polkasafe <> Polkassembly**\nPolkasafe team joined hands with Polkassembly to work together to create House of Commons. \nPolkassembly team had been mentoring the Polkasafe team from their inception. But as the Polkasafe team struggled to complete the project on time, we at Polkassembly, extended our hand, welcoming Polkasafe team members to join the Polkassembly team and build this product together, laying the foundations of the House of Commons.  \n\n**Milestone/Proposal 1 update**\nPolkasafe’s first treasury proposal was made in October’22 in Kusama. The idea was to build a comprehensive product solving for all potential use cases of multisig within the ecosystem. \nAll tasks were completed and detailed list can be found in the original proposal [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/220). \n\n**Development beyond proposal 1 milestones: \nMilestone 2** (Completed)\n\nThe first proposal and its milestones focussed on building a good product with a great UX. We achieved that, but went beyond to make the product 10x better. Let’s see the tasks we have completed and features we support now:\n1. Link multisig\n-- Just connect your wallet and we fetch and show all multisigs associated with that wallet, for you to choose and link with ease. \n2. Proxy Support\n-- Allow users to easily set proxy for multisig wallet\n-- Introduce checks and nudges if proxy is not set\n-- Allow users to add and remove signatories in 2 steps using proxy\n3. Additional network support(SDK & App)\n-- Polkasafe now supports Polkadot, Kusama, Asset Hubs on Kusama & Polkadot, Rococo & Westend. \n-- The app also supports other networks like Astar & Aleph Zero but work done for them is out of scope for this document. \n4. Custom Call data transactions\n-- Create a transaction using custom call data and still benefit from easy signing, notifications to signers, transaction notes, etc. \n5. Create extrinsic and sign as multi\n-- Want to create a complex, custom transaction? No need to go to Polkadot.js to do it. Just use Polkasafe and create any transaction to be signed as multi. \n6. Address category and additional info\n-- Users can now store additional information about signatories like discord, telegram, email\n-- Wallet Addresses can be categorized with tags like - Product, Full-Time, Marketing, etc. \n7. Transaction Tags and additional metadata\n-- Create settings page for Creation & Management of categories		\n-- Allow user to add transaction categories and sub-fields when creating transaction\n-- Display relevant data to all signatories in Queue, History and Notifications	\n\n8. Notification bots \n-- In-app notifications are usually best suited for Mobile apps, hence we had the need to develop notification solutions beyond in-app\n-- Discord, Telegram, Element & Slack bots allow you to set up any preferred channel for notifications and make your multisig experience 80% more effective. \n-- Email alerts\n9. Multi-currency support - \n-- Signatories can often be from/in different parts of the world and they would prefer to see treasury details in their native currency value, hence we added support for 10 different global currencies, allowing each user to have a more personalized experience. \n-- Supported currencies are - USD, GBP, EUR, CHF. AED, JPY, AUD, CAD, INR\n10. Shared Address Book - \n-- Based on community suggestions we built a shared address-book for seamless experience for all signatories of any multisig account. \n-- Users can also add new addresses and save them privately. \n-- Shared addresses can also have a private nickname(visible only to the signatory who sets it)\n11. Extend SDK support for all new features like custom transactions, call data signing, batch transactions and more. \n12. Transaction Batching(Bulk payouts)\n-- Users can make bulk-payments to multiple addresses in one single transaction\n-- Users will be able to add category and transaction tags, making it easier for other signatories to review and sign the transaction\n-- Use cases include salary payments, reimbursements, grants, airdrop, etc. \n13. Apps\n-- Apps are an attempt at increasing multisig usage within the ecosystem by enabling developers to add multisig support to their dApps.\n-- Current apps - Subsocial, Polkassembly, Astar Staking dashboard\n-- Upcoming - (In discussion) -Stellaswap\n14. Polkassembly app\n-- Polkassembly app was a deep integration done with the Polkassembly product enabling multisig usage within the product\n-- Sign-in with Polkasafe\n-- This sets it as a standard for anyone trying to use the Polkasafe SDK for enabling multisig sign-in in their app. \n-- Vote with Multisig\n-- Users can cast a vote on any proposal with their Polkasafe account, using any of the ecosystem wallets.\n-- Other signatories will get a notification on their preferred channel(Discord, Telegram, Slack, Element), requesting them to sign and execute the transaction. \n-- All this data is available to all signatories in Polkasafe, with complete proposal context and Polkassembly links, to understand the details of the transaction they are signing. \n15. Videos for tutorials\n-- Multiple videos have been made by the team explaining each feature of the product and helping users to understand and use Multisigs in the Polkadot ecosystem. You can find them here and the videos have been linked to specific product sections in the docs as well. \n16. SDK Docs\n-- Comprehensive documentation has been done for SDK and is available here. \n-- This has helped developers extensively while they integrate the Polkasafe SDK to bring Polkadot’s multisig functionality to their dApp. \n17. 2FA login\n-- Polkasafe now supports 2FA for your accounts, making it even more secure to use 🔐\n\nWe would like the community to share product feedback and feature requests with us here in this discussion post or reach out to us on hello@polkasafe.xyz\n\nMilestone 2 proposal has been created retroactively after completion of all tasks and Milestone 3 defines our roadmap for the product and we look forward to making Polkasafe the most-versatile multisig solution in the entire Polkadot ecosystem, enabling safe, secure self-custody of assets, and create a dApp ecosystem that supports multisig wallets using the Polkasafe SDK. \n\nDetailed proposal, task list, and budget details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TGJu5gHvO26lLw2Oh_wieZweSg00t1nfQV55h6KhKSE/edit?usp=sharing). \n\n**Proponent** - 15Un2AyaqUa46UvCkzAsijBy6dwyrCiF7rkVyKnT6WZqosB4\n\n**Requested allocation** - 194,050 USD\n\nWebsite: https://polkasafe.xyz\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PolkaSafe\n\nDocs: https://docs.polkasafe.xyz/\n\nSDK: https://github.com/polkasafe/polkasafe-sdk\n\nSDK Docs: https://polkasafe.gitbook.io/polkasafe-sdk/\n\nGithub: https://github.com/polkasafe/polkasafe-ui\n\nThankyou,\n\nRegards.\n\nPolkasafe Team\n'),(866,2,110,0,2,1,1,0,'0xd711c6f99f3a7ca23f6e589771db1b7d4b552a723346ec9b12d5554e438763a7',14,100,16856994,'15DCWHQknBjc5YPFoVj8Pn2KoqrqYywJJ95BYNYJ4Fj3NLqz',1,1692110040,4.96,1693579404,'12yi4uHFbnSUryffXT7Xq92fbGC3iXvCs3vz9HjVgpb4sBvL',10000,16870211,1693580010,4.22,NULL,68328108,10,65786119,'[Whitelisted Caller] Referendum #110: Update Parachain Validation Config','This referendum updates the parachain validation configuration in two ways:\n\n1.

Societal is building a parachain that makes it easy to organize, govern, and grow on-chain communities. Its streamlined SaaS application is the ideal platform to run any Polkadot community&rsquo;s operations, including the creator economy, protocols, social clubs, gaming, DAOs, and more.</p>\n<p>Societal is asking for $135,477.72 USD / 26,616 DOT in treasury funding to provide the ecosystem with a platform for community (token holder) operations and governance. Our application will work with any tokenized project in the ecosystem that is looking to add governance, treasury, and community management services to their operations.</p>\n<p>Earlier this Summer, Societal previously submitted a referendum for treasury funding, which you can find <a href=\"29\">here</a>. The proposal made it to the confirmation period twice, however it was aborted in the final hours and did not pass. We believe that we answered all the questions that were asked about the proposal to the best of our ability, and were pleased to see a strong community discussion and voter turnout. Our conclusion from the previous proposal is that the amount asked for was too large, especially as it was our inaugural ask for funding. We have gone back to the drawing board, and reduced the proposal by ~$52k.</p>\n<p>The reduction in the amount does come with a slightly smaller scope of work. We want to continue to prove ourselves as builders in the ecosystem and hope that we can be given the chance to do so with the new proposal amount.</p>\n<p>Societal has already completed most of the work required to become the operating system for decentralized communities in the Polkadot ecosystem. We are seeking funding to complete an array of final features of the product, including token import, governance, and proposal features, along with the management UI to support them. We will also use the funding to conduct final testing and to start onboarding users. These features will allow new and existing communities in the ecosystem to have access to a full suite of governance, treasury, and member management systems.</p>\n<p>Please find the revised proposal <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a4WNwwL85QI9sj53K-TKTHeC5-K18w4N9jAjeZ7OtvY/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>.

Also, this is a significantly smaller proposal, which only funds the bare minimum of maintenance (updates, user support and small improvements). In case this proposal fails, we will cease all of our support activities.\n\n\nThe [substrate-api-client](https://github.com/scs/substrate-api-client) is a Rust library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC from a no-std environment, like trusted execution environments or IoT devices. An RPC client is a library, with similar features as [Polkadot-js](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadotjs). With an RPC client developers can easily interact with any Polkadot or Kusama chain. There are [RPC clients](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-tools-index#rpc-and-api-tools) for different programming languages. For Rust, the most popular RPC client is [subxt](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt). The substrate-api-client uses core functionality of subxt and makes it available in a no-std environment.\n\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of our previous maintenance proposals: [Nov22-Jan23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/26), [Feb23-Apr23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88), [May23-Jul23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/182).

Governance discussions take place off-chain and are thus fragmented, projects have to rely on Discord and Telegram to interact with their communities, and suboptimal solutions are implemented for connecting these Web2 accounts to users&rsquo; Web3 accounts. Furthermore, by forcing communities to live off-chain, user engagement with dapps is lowered. We realized that, although Web3 communities, and their communications, should be moved on-chain (in order to solve the aforementioned problems), there was too much friction with actually using a blockchain for this.</p>\n<p>In May, we released the final piece of our UX (user experience) solution, enabling Web3 social to provide a familiar Web2 UX that is so smooth, even your grandma can do it.

Integration tests are the most advanced type of tests. They are no less than the automation of what a real user would do with the Dapp. Clicking buttons, sending transactions, making mistakes, etc.<br />Right now, developers have to mock the responses from the wallet and from the nodes. They spend a lot of time developing solutions which provide few guarantees because the tests are running against mocked responses. If the interface or the answers from the node or the wallet change, the mocks have to be updated and unless the developers pay close attention, they may only discover these changes in prod. As a Dapp, Multix faces the same issues. This is the reason why we propose to build a plugin for the popular testing framework <a href=\"https://www.cypress.io\">Cypress</a> . This open-source plugin will allow teams to automate Dapp integration tests, without the need for mocking. As we talked to Dapp developers in our network, from Talisman to InvArch, our contacts have shared their enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>There is no better way to build a tool than to build it for your own needs. This will not only benefit Multix but also the entire ecosystem.

Deliverables are as follows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Fs1D3rV/chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"639\" height=\"404\" /></p>\n<p>As this was proposed on 4.25.2023, we improved and added some deliverables. We implement every crypto primitive from scratch. Deliverables consist of Substrate<strong> crypto-friendly scaffold</strong>, <strong>ZkRollup</strong>, and <strong>privacy-preserving </strong>transactions. Unique features are as follows.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>Substrate crypto-friendly scaffold</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Full SCALE and no_std <strong>Compatible</strong></li>\n<li>Avoid <strong>Code Duplication</strong></li>\n<li>Replace with new Algorithm <strong>Easily</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, the main issue is <strong>runtime compatibility</strong>. We have been working on crypto projects and when we tried to use crypto functions on Substrate runtime, we needed to make every library dependency compatible with Polkadot or implement host functions and connect each other with conversion interfaces. This accounted for most of the development workload. To avoid this workload and import directly to Substrate runtime, we implement <strong>fully compatible libraries</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, we think how easy it is to apply optimization is important because performance directly affects the user\'s experience. We separate the interface and algorithm in order to <strong>avoid code duplication</strong> and replace them with new algorithms<strong> easily</strong>.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>ZkRollups</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Crypto-Friendly Signing Algorithm</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Batch Signature Validation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Runtime Compatibility</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When we worked on the EVM ZkRollups previously, we found that it reduced gas costs and the prover process was not so heavy as it could be done on the GitHub Actions environment.</p>\n<p>However, users were necessary to create <strong>layer2-specific wallets</strong> aside from the main blockchain, and the prover cost was<strong> not optimized</strong>.</p>\n<p>We integrate the wallet between layer 2 and the main blockchain to <strong>avoid wallet recreation</strong> and, replace the signing algorithm with an efficient hash function and curve, and introduce batch signature validation to <strong>reduce the prover workload</strong> by native field proving. This ZkRollup works in a <strong>WASM</strong> environment.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>Privacy-Preserving Transactions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Account-Based</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Auditable</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Plonk</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>When we worked on the confidential transfers previously, we found that <strong>audibility</strong> was necessary because of recent regurgitation and <strong>UTXO-base</strong> was inefficient perspectives from zero-knowledge proof and on-chain memory space.</p>\n<p>We implement the first <strong>account-based</strong> privacy-preserving transactions with Plonk. This privacy-preserving transaction is <strong>auditable</strong> and saves<strong> computation and memory space</strong> because of account-based. Account-based is also useful when we extend transaction functionalities and <strong>interact </strong>with other crypto schemes.</p>\n<h2>Progress</h2>\n<p><strong>19 out of 31</strong> milestones were completed.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;Polkadot Compatible Crypto Primitive</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/primitive/zkstd\">Zero Knowledge Proof Standard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/primitive/elgamal\">ElGamal Encryption</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/primitive/jubjub\">Jubjub curve</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/primitive/bls12_381\">Bls12 381</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/primitive/poly\">Polynomial Commitment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/primitive/redjubjub\">Redjubjub Signature</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/primitive/zksnarks\">ZkSnarks Primitive</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/primitive/pairing\">Tate Pairing</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Substrate Pallet Functionalities</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://kogarashinetwork.github.io/Kogarashi/tutorial/reddsa_wallet/\">RedDSA Wallet CLI Tutorial</a> &nbsp;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/pallets/encrypted_balance\">Encrypted Balance</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/zksubstrate\">Zero Knowledge Friendly Substrate Runtime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/pallets/confidential_transfer\">Confidential Transfer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/pallets/plonk\">Plonk on Substrate</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Past Activities</h2>\n<h3>Web3 Foundation Grant</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>ZkRollups: EVM ZkRollups W3F grant collaboration with Astar Network</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/zk-rollups.md\">https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/zk-rollups.md</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/AstarNetwork/ZKRollups\">https://github.com/AstarNetwork/ZKRollups</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ZkPlonk: Polkadot compatible Plonk W3F grant collaboration with Astar Network</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/zk-plonk.md\">https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/zk-plonk.md</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/AstarNetwork/plonk\">https://github.com/AstarNetwork/plonk</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy Transfer: Account-base privacy transfer transaction</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/zero-network.md\">https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/zero-network.md</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/pallets/confidential_transfer\">https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork/Kogarashi/tree/master/pallets/confidential_transfer</a></p>\n<h3>Substrate Builder Program</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Deliverly Milestone 1<br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KogarashiCrypto/status/1684396867944349696\">https://twitter.com/KogarashiCrypto/status/1684396867944349696</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>&nbsp;Legal Structure</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Registered Address</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2F・3F Emblem Nishiarai, 3-33-6 Umejima, Adachi City, Tokyo-to 121-0816, Japan</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Registered Legal Entity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Invers Inc.</p>\n<h2>About Us</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://kogarashi-network.com/\">Website</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KogarashiCrypto\">Twitter</a> <a href=\"https://discord.gg/g3q7tsHKTd\">Discord</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/KogarashiNetwork\">Github</a> <a href=\"https://kogarashinetwork.github.io/Kogarashi/\">Documentation</a></p>'),(878,2,122,0,2,1,1,0,'0x2b942c761769485630bb3606f44d8a88bf3df002be09c7b9c51b1e318c2f107a',70,100,16952611,'15DCWHQknBjc5YPFoVj8Pn2KoqrqYywJJ95BYNYJ4Fj3NLqz',1,1692684042,4.41,1693545834,'13sDzot2hwoEAzXJiNe3cBiMEq19XRqrS3DMAxt9jiSNKMkA',10000,16954965,1693546440,4.27,NULL,82068350,5000,76180562,'[Whitelisted Caller] Referendum #122: Register KSM on Asset Hub','Enacting this proposal will register the asset { parents: 2, interior: GlobalConsensus(Kusama) } on the Polkadot Asset Hub.

We also firmly believe that appchains will be the ultimate form of the web3 world. However, at present, due to the relatively high entry threshold of the Polkadot parachain and the relatively low influence of the EVM parachains, many users with lightweight application needs are turning to other well-known EVM platforms. This has also resulted in a certain loss of users within the ecosystem.\n\nAlthough the arrival of On-demand parathreads will alleviate this situation, we are still in a transition phase from smart contract dApps to appchains. Therefore, there remains a significant demand for smart contract platforms. However, DOT, as the most vital asset of Polkadot, currently cannot directly fulfill this demand scenario.\n\n**Project Overview**\n\nIn order to complete the use cases for DOT and enable a comprehensive user base from enterprise-level users to lightweight users, Magnet will be a smart contract platform based on the PAYG model, with DOT as the gas fee. The platform\'s key features are summarized as follows:\n\n- **Magnet without Tokens**: All token functions will be carried out by DOT, including contract deployment, transaction fees, governance, etc. \n- **Magnet will support EVM and WASM:** As EVM currently dominates the smart contract market, the first phase of development will primarily focus on EVM, followed by support for WASM smart contracts.\n- **Magnet will be built on the PAYG Model**: This will allow a more flexible approach to connect to the Polkadot network and obtain its security guarantees. The price difference between platform Gas fees and blockspace can also provide a certain business income for Magnet, funding its long-term operations.\n- **Magnet will be developed based on Tanssi Network**: Magnet will ultimately provide services to users in the form of containerchain/appchain with the support of Tanssi Network. Tanssi\'s support will also accelerate Magnet\'s development.\n- **Magnet will integrate XCM**: XCM will serve as the foundation for DOT\'s transfer to the platform, ensuring its smooth operation.\n- **Income distribution**: Revenues generated from operations will be distributed to the Polkadot treasury, Collators, system reserves, and project operations. Most of the income will be distributed, with Magnet retaining only the basic fees for project maintenance.\n\nForum Discussion on this Proposal:[Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/does-a-contract-platform-that-uses-dot-as-gas-fees-make-sense/3013)\n\nBlog Post about this Proposal: [medium](https://medium.com/@acaishiba/magnet-polkadots-smart-contract-scaling-dock-based-on-the-payg-model-eb74ffefd4a)\n\n**Full Proposal**: [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aoNytxaOzzhQ6DC9MCiMd6VuPOgS21-oZRxsMNkbjnQ/edit?usp=sharing)'),(881,2,125,129145,6,1,34,0,'0x5f301e38b84f6d58f3cf09f25e29d2e1c9e42e53714e9f7919588ca09e79cb17',43,100,16955865,'15cfSaBcTxNr8rV59cbhdMNCRagFr3GE6B3zZRsCp4QHHKPu',1,1692703572,4.40,1694767182,'15cfSaBcTxNr8rV59cbhdMNCRagFr3GE6B3zZRsCp4QHHKPu',400,16958265,1694853666,4.19,NULL,25778966,8589727,8609497,'Nova Spektr Milestone 3 Proposal: Dynamic Derivations, WalletConnect v2, Proxy accounts, Cross-chain transfers, Fiat values, Ethereum address support, Staking improvements, Wallet details, App Store and Microsoft Store','<p><strong>Nova Spektr Milestone 3 Proposal: <br />Dynamic Derivations, WalletConnect v2, Proxy accounts, Cross-chain transfers, Fiat values, Ethereum address support, Staking improvements, Wallet details, App Store and Microsoft Store:<br /></strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QqqXflJsE-Y5xKVYM0KYe8AHRs9apr1QChqv-BLvy94/\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QqqXflJsE-Y5xKVYM0KYe8AHRs9apr1QChqv-BLvy94/</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/dgk44rd/Nova-Spektr-M3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"604\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Feature set of the Nova Spektr M3 proposal (see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QqqXflJsE-Y5xKVYM0KYe8AHRs9apr1QChqv-BLvy94/edit#heading=h.y0kt8dd6f7bb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proposal</a>):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dynamic Derivations for Polkadot Vault</li>\n<li>WalletConnect v2 integration</li>\n<li>Cross-chain transfers</li>\n<li>Fiat values integration</li>\n<li>Proxy accounts and transactions</li>\n<li>Wallet details, forget and rename wallet</li>\n<li>Distribute the Nova Spektr application to App Store and Microsoft Store</li>\n<li>In-app updates</li>\n<li>Staking improvements</li>\n<li>Ethereum address support</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://novaspektr.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Nova Spektr</strong></a> (formerly Omni Enterprise) is an <strong>all-in-one Polkadot desktop application</strong> focused on enterprise adoption that provides a one-stop-shop for stakeholders with advanced needs, enterprises and DAOs, and individual users in the entire ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Nova Spektr</strong> provides the following enterprise-focused feature set:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Support for 70+ Polkadot ecosystem networks </strong></li>\n<li><strong>User-friendly Multisigs for 55+ networks</strong> &amp; all their assets</li>\n<li><strong>Multishard staking</strong> for Relay chains and solo-chains</li>\n<li><strong>Hardware wallet</strong> support for <strong>Polkadot Vault </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Light client integration</strong> for Polkadot and Kusama support</li>\n<li><strong>Parachain Data Verification</strong> for verifying data from public RPC endpoints</li>\n<li><strong>Secure &amp; Open source </strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://metadata.novasama.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metadata portal</a> </strong>for 70+ Polkadot eco networks</li>\n<li><strong>Funded by the Polkadot Treasury</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In July 2022, our previous <a href=\"../treasury/150\">(2nd) Treasury Proposal</a> was approved, and by June 2023, we successfully delivered upon all the milestone&rsquo;s proposed features and more.&nbsp;Please refer to <a href=\"https://medium.com/novasama-technologies/meet-nova-spektr-the-all-in-one-polkadot-desktop-wallet-b9918c9a9541\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nova Spektr Release article</a>, as well as watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwcXwHPS8cw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nova Spektr Demo #1</a> and read <a href=\"../post/1848\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Milestone 2 report</a> to review the features which we have delivered.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal for <strong>Nova Spektr is to be all-in-one Polkadot desktop applicaiton</strong>, focused on enterprise, power users, and individuals use cases.

Composable&rsquo;s tech stack is comprised of the following components:</p>\n<p><strong>Picasso:</strong> Composable&rsquo;s Kusama Parachain</p>\n<p><strong>Pablo DEX:</strong> where users may swap assets native to the DotSama ecosystem</p>\n<p><strong>Centauri:</strong> a trustless, IBC-based cross-chain bridge</p>\n<p><strong>Cross-Chain Virtual Machine (XCVM):</strong> to communicate smart contract instruction sets between chains</p>\n<p>Cumulatively, these components focus on the goal of extending the reach of assets native to the DotSama ecosystem by enabling seamless movement and orchestration of assets between external chains.</p>\n<h2 id=\"objectives\"><strong>Objectives:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage cross-chain adoption of DOT by first providing liquidity to Osmosis DEX within the Cosmos ecosystem and achieving $50,000 of average daily trading volume within the first 3 months</li>\n<li>Extend DOT accessibility by collaborating with Neutron to supply liquidity to Astroport DEX and integrate DOT to applications deployed via its platform</li>\n<li>Promote Polkadot visibility by acquiring 1,000 new DOT holders within the first 6 months of loan deployment</li>\n<li>Integrate DOT with Cosmos applications outside of pure DEX platforms</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"problemstatement\"><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></h2>\n<p>Polkadot network&rsquo;s native token, DOT, holds a current market capitalization of roughly $6.9b. Despite the proliferation of cross-chain DeFi, the DOT token has remained largely isolated within its own ecosystem which has become a point of obstruction for visibility to onboard non-native users. Cross-chain DEX listings act as an entranceway for new users to interact with and utilize a new token across DeFi platforms, but the two largest sources of liquidity for DOT that exist outside of its own ecosystem come from listings on PancakeSwap (BSC) and Osmosis (in the form of axlDOT) which account for just ~$605k of active liquidity with roughly 53% of that TVL residing in PancakeSwap alone.</p>\n<p>Although Polkadot has experienced strong growth within its own ecosystems across 40+ parachains operating on the network, DOT has been less than notable amongst its usage in cross-chain applications. As the cross-chain narrative within crypto networks has continued to evolve, DOT has been bottlenecked by the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lack of Decentralized Bridging Solutions to the Polkadot Ecosystem:</strong> HRMP channels exist within the Polkadot ecosystem which allow DOT to be transferred amongst existing parachains. HRMP lacks the ability to connect directly to external chains, thus leaving DOT isolated within the Polkadot eco and failing to capitalize on market opportunities throughout additional base layer networks such as Cosmos and Ethereum. Composable has built an IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) based bridge allowing the transfer of DOT outside of its native chain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Segregated Liquidity and Shortage of Accessible DEX Listings:</strong> Polkadot has amassed one of the largest market capitalizations amongst crypto networks (currently #13 by mcap), but has notably been one of the least used tokens throughout cross-chain applications. At the moment, one of the only existing cross-chain uses of DOT is via Axelar&rsquo;s axlDOT pool on Osmosis, which lacks significant liquidity to be used past the pool itself (currently ~ $280k total pool liquidity + $3.5k 24hr volume)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cross-Chain Interaction Beyond Polkadot:</strong> DOT allocated towards this proposal will have the ability to move outside of the DotSama ecosystem over Composable&rsquo;s Centauri bridge to access a new DeFi user base, initially via Osmosis. This opens an entirely new opportunity set for DOT to be used within additional platforms and users through dApps and the ability to offer liquidity incentives outside of its native chain.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through Composable&rsquo;s cross-chain bridging solution, Centauri, DOT may be extended past its native network. Centauri currently allows DOT to be transferred between Polkadot and Kusama, and the Cosmos ecosystem. This proposal seeks to move 188679.245283 DOT (apprx. $1m) from the Polkadot Treasury to Cosmos using Composable&rsquo;s Centauri bridge in order to enable accessible DOT liquidity within the Cosmos ecosystem through DEX liquidity pools on Osmosis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefitsandgoals\"><strong>Benefits and Goals:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Create widespread visibility and use of DOT through cross-chain applications, beginning with Osmosis within Cosmos</li>\n<li>Cosmos&rsquo; three most active zones consist of Osmosis, Stride, and the Cosmos Hub which account for ~30,000 daily active users that may be onboarded as new DOT holders and users</li>\n<li>Build a tighter relationship in cross-chain DeFi between Polkadot and Cosmos users to encourage assets to be brought back into the Polkadot ecosystem for use amongst parachain applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal of this proposal is to achieve cross-chain liquidity for DOT within the Cosmos ecosystem through liquidity pools hosted by Osmosis and Astroport as well as onboard new DOT token holders outside of the ecosystem. Additionally, this initiative is focused not only on moving DOT outside of its native chain, but also garnering attention in order to bring new assets back into DotSama.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ongoinginitiativesfordotwithincosmos\"><strong>Ongoing Initiatives for DOT within Cosmos</strong></h2>\n<p>The following links and mentions highlight initiatives currently underway by the Composable team to integrate DOT across the Cosmos ecosystem, to provide a vision for possibilities of integrating DOT amongst existing dApps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.osmosis.zone/t/implement-composable-s-centauri-bridge-as-the-canonical-route-to-the-polkadot-and-kusama-ecosystem/179/7\">Canonical DOT Bridge + Asset on Osmosis</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DOT/OSMO pool on Osmosis (created; pending visibility via front end update)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://gov.umee.cc/discussion/12402-listing-proposal-add-support-for-dot\">UMEE ibc-DOT Lending</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://community.agoric.com/t/dot-inter-protocol-vaults-collateral-onboarding-discussion/403\">Agoric - DOT Vault Collateral for IST</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.astroport.fi/pools\">Astroport DOT/USDC Pool </a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mars Protocol - DOT Collateral for Lending (pending discussion post)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cosmos Assets accessible within the DotSama ecosystem via <a href=\"https://app.pablo.finance/provide-liquidity/\">Pablo DEX</a> &ndash; ATOM, stATOM, OSMO, STRD, STARS, SCRT, UMEE, BLD, CRE, NTRN</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"marketing\"><strong>Marketing</strong></h2>\n<p>Composable will promote and market this proposal over the course of discussion, voting, and deployment to raise awareness around the benefits to both ecosystems and attract users. The following marketing channels will be used in order to achieve maximum visibility around the proposal and its end goals:</p>\n<p><strong>i) Twitter Threads</strong> &ndash; The proposal will be promoted to both Polkadot and Cosmos community over explanatory Twitter threads explaining the ultimate purpose of the funding and how it will be effectively deployed</p>\n<p><strong>ii) Twitter Spaces</strong> &ndash; Joint discussion between Composable, Osmosis, and members of Web3 Community</p>\n<p><strong>iii) Blog Posts</strong> &ndash; Upon completion of the proposal, Composable will release a blog post to its medium encompassing an explanation of the funding, how it is being deployed, what goals it seeks to achieve, how the liquidity in Cosmos can benefit DotSama, and what opportunities this creates for the future New Holder Growth</p>\n<p>Within the first year of Osmosis launch, ATOM holders within the Cosmos ecosystem increased by roughly 800,000 new holders (pictured above). ATOM&rsquo;s launch within Osmosis DEX heavily contributed to the ability to onboard new ATOM holder, which we expect a similar effect on a DOT listing with ample liquidity. We will be targeting an initial milestone of 10,000 new DOT holders within the Cosmos ecosystem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"newholdergrowth\"><strong>New Holder Growth</strong></h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/F0F49kH/Screen-Shot-2023-08-09-at-5-08-40-PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Within the first year of Osmosis launch, ATOM holders within the Cosmos ecosystem increased by roughly 800,000 new holders (pictured above).

Impermanent loss impacts an LP most significantly if the price of one asset in the pool increases while the paired asset&rsquo;s price remains stable. To outline a simple version of the expected result in these scenarios, a simple table is included below based on a total LP position of $1000 ($500 of asset A + $500 of asset B). Our expectation is that the ROI on swap fee + incentives will outpace losses due to IL in the pool.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/rtwT1J1/Screen-Shot-2023-08-09-at-5-21-00-PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><code>$1000 LP position used as example</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/t8SDwq9/Screen-Shot-2023-08-09-at-5-21-11-PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><code>Table to outline potential losses incurred by IL based on movement of both assets within an Osmosis pool</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"loanrepayment\"><strong>Loan Repayment</strong></h2>\n<p>Despite potential for IL within an AMM liquidity pool, we believe the earning potential of participating in this pool will be able to mitigate any negative returns of participating in the pool. Based on current swap fees and incentive matching program on Osmosis, providing liquidity to a DOT/OSMO pool has the potential returns as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/8BHX38c/Screen-Shot-2023-08-09-at-5-23-31-PM.png\" alt=\"\" /> <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/KK1xPd7/Screen-Shot-2023-08-09-at-5-23-38-PM.png\" alt=\"\" /> <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/4dnjZSk/Screen-Shot-2023-08-09-at-5-23-46-PM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>In total, using a reasonable estimate of $25,000 Daily Volume + 1yr of Incentives at $500k total liquidity provided, the total amount of return expected should be approximately $68,500 which can be used to offset IL and repurchase DOT to return to treasury. This would be split between liquidity providers (ie, in the case of DOT/OSMO -&gt; 1/2 to be sold back for loan coverage, 1/2 to Osmosis)</p>\n<p>Rewards received in the form of OSMO liquidity incentives can be sold on a bi-weekly cadence, as to reduce risk that may be assumed by holding additional assets.</p>\n<h2 id=\"milestonesfordeployment\"><strong>Milestones for Deployment</strong></h2>\n<p>Funds will be received from the treasury and deployed according to milestones outlined in the table below. Success would be achieved through the steps outlined as follows:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/ys2HpGm/Screen-Shot-2023-08-10-at-9-13-31-AM.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation\"><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Multisig</strong></p>\n<p>The DOT received through this proposal will be handled by four multisig addresses across the (i) Polkadot relay chain, (ii) Composable parachain, (iii) Picasso parachain, and (iv) Osmosis chain. The collection of multisigs will be used to handle DOT securely across each cross-chain transfer as funds are moved from Polkadot &rarr; Composable &rarr; Picasso &rarr; Osmosis. Multisig accounts on the DotSama side will be handled via 3-of-5 signature scheme comprised of Henry Love (Fundamental Labs), James Wo (DFG Capital), Notional DAO, Joe DeTommaso (Head of Strategy, Composable), and 0xBrainjar (Head of Research, Composable) Once assets have been moved to Osmosis from the DotSama eco, DOT will be transferred to the Osmosis multisig to be handled as directed only as outlined here via Polkadot governance.</p>\n<p>Once successful deployment and milestones have been achieved with Osmosis, a similar multisig outline will be constructed to handle funds moving from Polkadot &rarr; Neutron.</p>\n<p>One additional solution is a new suite of secure smart contracts being developed by <a href=\"https://timewave.computer/\">Timewave</a>. Timewave functions as an Interchain Allocator which can facilitate protocol to protocol deal making and spending. In the event that Timewave is utilized, it would reside on the Cosmos side of the needed asset transfers, and would handle the deposit and withdrawal of liquidity to the protocols designated within this proposal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"liquidityprovision\"><strong>Liquidity Provision</strong></h2>\n<p>This proposal will outline explicit instructions for the movement and deployment of DOT received from the Polkadot Treasury as outlined below:</p>\n<p><strong>Movement of Funds:</strong></p>\n<p>Polkadot Treasury will release initial funds to multisig address (i) where the DOT will then be transferred to multisig address (ii) on the Composable parachain via Centauri.</p>\n<p>Two subsequent transfers will then occur. First, Centauri will again be used to move funds from the Composable parachin to multisig address (iii) on the Picasso parachain. Finally, another Centauri transfer will be used to move the DOT from Picasso outside of the ecosystem to multisig (iv) residing on Osmosis (within the Cosmos ecosystem).</p>\n<p><strong>Deployment of Funds:</strong></p>\n<p>Once funds have been received by the Osmosis multisig, the multisig will add liquidity to the DOT/OSMO pool which has been previously created by the Composable team. OSMO incentive matching will be requested via governance, and through a successful vote, the DOT/OSMO liquidity pool will begin to receive OSMO incentives provided to LP&rsquo;s.</p>\n<h2 id=\"audits\"><strong>Audits:</strong></h2>\n<p>Audits for the Composable stack can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/ComposableFi/composable/tree/main/audits\">here</a></p>\n<p><strong>Appendix</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pancakeswap.finance/info/v3/tokens/0x7083609fce4d1d8dc0c979aab8c869ea2c873402\">PankcakeSwap</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://info.osmosis.zone/token/DOT\">Osmosis</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mapofzones.com/home/cosmoshub-4/overview?columnKey=ibcVolume&amp;period=24h\">Map Of Zones</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-rpc.dwellir.com#/treasury\">Polkadot Treasury</a></p>\n<p>[DailyDefi IL Calc](<a href=\"https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/\">https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/</a> )</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/impermanent-loss-calculator\">Coingecko IL Calc</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://atomscan.com/stats/accounts\">AtomScan</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Update &mdash; Multisig:</strong><br />The multsig Polkadot address set to handle this proposal will be :</p>\n<p>1ngtfgu1dYwXBTQGzWkaDfgBFeqjzSsYzdLpzNzVENh7kNA<br /><br />This is comprised of the following signers:<br />DFG Capital : 12saVkpyC6LJyk1ELETE76eZD3mtDT2LAdKxd4nEEQVAigyu <br />Notional DAO :&nbsp;12ZJEbSiYQ3XJXSqX1KwicmeXnuDCH2uXadxU2i8VeyXsAre<br />Henry Love :&nbsp;14GFeMR58WfYCXTh4BkZUargD5uaHujneWoYHsTwEceV9rEp<br />Omar Zaki :&nbsp;14kxR7CR4XYdRU2fRdWWFbkZXziM4JCQHCtZpirvZssotHGZ<br />Joe DeTommaso :&nbsp;15YLDvV6Q2NUVEFBN26kRgHyyeH1Bu91NKTwBg3xW3hEVfoj</p>\n<p><strong>Update &mdash; Removal of sudo:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.composable.finance/networks/picasso/governance\">https://docs.composable.finance/networks/picasso/governance</a></p>'),(885,2,129,59895,3,1,33,0,'0xfee7257089f0060feda6fb568b48a368a775d83c71a3e8658db78076cc715a02',43,100,16967164,'16XXocb76BpprdspsR7j5iWFHf4aTMnsVHxgGBXfixs1FFLb',1,1692771396,4.40,NULL,'16XXocb76BpprdspsR7j5iWFHf4aTMnsVHxgGBXfixs1FFLb',200,16969564,NULL,NULL,NULL,1053668,21799859,370987,'Encointer Treasury Proposal (budget halving)','<p>In our recent <a href=\"33\">referendum 33</a>, DOT holders decided against funding Encointer&rsquo;s current burn rate of 100kCHF/mt (1.5% of current treasury influx).

In this document we will be focused on a detailed description of the steps taken to resolve the issue.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>\n<p>The Nodle Parachain is bricked after its last upgrade failed. This proposal proposes to use the <em>forceSetCode</em> functionality on Polkadot to ensure the prompt restart of the parachain.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n<p>The solution presented below intends to maintain the existing Parachain state, and not require to revert previously approved transactions which would break finality guarantees.</p>\n<p>It appears everything in the recent upgrade was sound with all state transitions being correct and intended. However, <em>the migration code associated with the upgrade is taking too long and caused the proof of verification to grow beyond what the relay chain validators tolerates</em>. Because the migration happens right when the runtime is upgraded, this causes the parachain to halt block production as the next block would always be rejected by the Polkadot validators. <em>As such, the head of the parachain did not progress to any undesired state, and thus can be reused</em>.</p>\n<p>This means that it should be possible to unbrick the parachain by force setting the current code to a new runtime that is very similar to the stored runtime. As such, <a href=\"https://github.com/NodleCode/chain/releases/tag/2.2.2-hotfix\">a new runtime has been prepared</a> with the changes below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identical spec version than initially deployed</li>\n<li>Keeps the uniques pallet at the same storage prefix</li>\n<li>Remove the migration</li>\n<li>Remove the new pallet associated to the migration</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When this code is forced on the relay chain then collators can use the <em>--wasm-runtime-overrides</em> flag to force their nodes to use the appropriate wasm code that is recognized by the relay chain.</p>\n<p><strong>Testing and verification</strong></p>\n<p>Here are the steps we took to test this proposal:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We used <em>polkadot-launch</em> and ran a local rococo relay chain with a few validators and a collator of our <em>eden-dev</em> parachain. All with fresh states starting from scratch. For the relay chain binary we used <em>Polkadot-0.9.42</em> and for our parachain we used <em>nodle-2.0.30</em> which is the previously published image for our nodes and contains the exact same runtime as it was on our chain right before the problematic upgrade.</li>\n<li>We made runtime wasm out of <a href=\"https://github.com/NodleCode/chain/blob/sample-failure/runtimes/eden/src/migrations.rs#L25-L26\">code</a> that could easily induce the heavy migration step for a local test. We selected the integration of an infinite loop as the fastest way to reproduce the conditions of the issue.</li>\n<li>We upgraded the local collators runtime with the runtime wasm which had the intentional failure in its migration. We noticed the node indeed stopped producing blocks with the exact same message as we had seen on our collator &ldquo;Discarding proposal &hellip;took too long&ldquo;. <em>This confirms correct reproduction of the current issue</em>.</li>\n<li>We then used Sudo on the local rococo relay chain and called <em>forceSetCurrentCode</em> with the <a href=\"https://github.com/NodleCode/chain/releases/tag/2.2.2-hotfix\">runtime wasm</a> that we are going to use in our proposal. Let&rsquo;s refer to that as the good runtime. We already have discussed the idea behind this code change in the Solution section above.</li>\n<li>We then stopped the collator and re-ran it using <em>--wasm-runtime-overrides</em> and setting it to the folder that contained the good runtime. The storage of the collator was maintained and no modification was made there. After the restart the collator started producing blocks and the relay chain backed and included them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Proposal Preimage</strong></p>\n<p>Our proposal is <em>paras -&gt; forceSetCurrentCode(para: 2026, newCode: [our good runtime]</em>, leading to the preimage hash of &ldquo;<em>0xbdeb173184c3a932473b7921c0feb233900bbe9228c54dc346239a93b186e9cc</em>&rdquo; and preimage length of <em>1216833</em> as shown in the following screenshot:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/p4jJth8/Screenshot-2023-08-24-at-2-05-52-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Prevention Strategy</strong></p>\n<p>We intend to work with the Polkadot community to improve existing testing tools to detect similar issues to the one being fixed today. Namely, we would like to extend <em>try-runtime</em> to at least show if the PoV for a runtime upgrade is growing beyond the 5MB limit that is set for validators. Alternatively, this could also take the form of an independent test tool as well.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what tool is developed, we will enforce the benchmarking of any migration code in our upgrade process.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we would like to investigate whether some patches could be contributed to the Polkadot codebase to optimize for the liveness of parachains by falling back to the last known good runtime in case of upgrade or migration failures. Because this sounds like a much bigger effort given our team expertise, we will need further discussions on this topic.</p>'),(891,2,136,950,2,1,31,0,'0x8fc6b423da16d84236fb831542ede28d52fc3fce1a68c9992adf1eae163bbba2',42,100,17070315,'14DsLzVyTUTDMm2eP3czwPbH53KgqnQRp3CJJZS9GR7yxGDP',1,1693390548,4.59,1693911126,'14DsLzVyTUTDMm2eP3czwPbH53KgqnQRp3CJJZS9GR7yxGDP',10,17070415,1693911726,4.27,NULL,1259065,49597,835253,'Create & implement RFC14 - Improve locking mechanism for parachains','<p>I have proposed <a href=\"https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/14\">RFC14 - Improve locking mechanism for parachains</a> and it has been accepted by the Fellowship. I have also completed the <a href=\"https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/1290\">implementation for RFC14.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Summary for RFC 14:</strong></p>\n<p>This RFC proposes a set of changes to the parachain lock mechanism. The goal is to allow a parachain manager to self-service the parachain without root track governance action.</p>\n<p>This is achieved by remove existing lock conditions and only lock a parachain when:</p>\n<p>&mdash; A parachain manager explicitly lock the parachain</p>\n<p>&mdash; OR a parachain block is produced successfully</p>\n<p><strong>Motivation for RFC14</strong></p>\n<p>The manager of a parachain has permission to manage the parachain when the parachain is unlocked. Parachains are by default locked when onboarded to a slot. This requires the parachain wasm/genesis must be valid, otherwise a root track governance action on relaychain is required to update the parachain.</p>\n<p>The current reliance on root track governance actions for managing parachains can be time-consuming and burdensome. This RFC aims to address this technical difficulty by allowing parachain managers to take self-service actions, rather than relying on general public voting.</p>\n<p>The key scenarios this RFC seeks to improve are:</p>\n<p>1. Rescue a parachain with invalid wasm/genesis.</p>\n<p>While we have various resources and templates to build a new parachain, it is still not a trivial task. It is very easy to make a mistake and resulting an invalid wasm/genesis. With lack of tools to help detect those issues1, it is very likely that the issues are only discovered after the parachain is onboarded on a slot. In this case, the parachain is locked and the parachain team has to go through a lengthy governance process to rescue the parachain.</p>\n<p>2. Perform lease renewal for an existing parachain.</p>\n<p>One way to perform lease renewal for a parachain is by doing a least swap with another parachain with a longer lease. This requires the other parachain must be operational and able to perform XCM transact call into relaychain to dispatch the swap call. Combined with the overhead of setting up a new parachain, this is an time consuming and expensive process. Ideally, the parachain manager should be able to perform the lease swap call without having a running parachain2.</p>'),(892,2,135,0,7,1,33,0,'0x752d87e68d7114b4c986bc0a573715039599a0f7fb779fe2fbc3f6a0cc4c99e6',3,100,17028386,'13YWynHAu8F8uKZFbQwvPgJ67xizvo21HCEQU3Ke8z1XHoyT',1,1693138818,4.51,1695106890,'13YWynHAu8F8uKZFbQwvPgJ67xizvo21HCEQU3Ke8z1XHoyT',200,17030786,1695193506,4.11,NULL,14190929,335416,4875301,'Moderation Team Bounty','<p><strong>The discussion for this proposal was open for 2.5 weeks.

Our goal is to attract new developers to this space by simplifying the process of starting and managing projects.</p>\n<p><strong>This proposal aims to claim funding from the Polkadot Treasury for work on the Swanky Suite tool, Drink! Tool, ink! examples, and educational content in the period from September 2023 to February 2024.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>To ensure transparency and accountability, we propose a task-based approach to funding. Our roadmap clearly outlines each stage of ink!Hub\'s development, with defined objectives and deliverables.

Without them innovation may slow in Polkadot, as developers incur real costs to find and secure access to scalable and reliable public endpoints.</p>\n<p>Wallets, indexers, governance tools, and other applications that we take for granted rely on these free public endpoints to power their applications, and without a diverse set of RPC providers, the Polkadot community will become more centralised and at risk of outages.</p>\n<h1 id=\"onfinalitysrpcservice\">OnFinality\'s RPC Service</h1>\n<p>As Polkadot\'s largest and most cost efficient infrastructure provider, we provide scalable free public API services for Polkadot, Statemint, Westend, Collectives, Encointer and have recently added Bridgehub Polkadot and Bridgehub Westend</p>\n<p>Since our inception in November 2020 we have a long track record focussing on three key areas; performance/reliability, providing more value from our Ultimate API service, and cost optimisation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"performancereliability\">Performance/Reliability</h3>\n<p>OnFinality is operationally striving for a minimum of 99.99% reliability, which means less than an hour of downtime each year. We are the only RPC provider to guarantee this with actual financial penalties (see appendix A). We proudly display and share our <a href=\"https://status.onfinality.io/\">90 day uptime statistics</a> for each network publicly <a href=\"https://status.onfinality.io/uptime/r40wwpclbwzm\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>We have invested hugely into a team dedicated to optimising our application gateway and caching layer to ensure that we provide the fastest possible service for our customers. We run clusters in 5 different regions (North Virginia, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Singapore, and Australia) and across 4 different cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Alicloud, and our own dedicated hardware) to ensure that we are fault tolerant to any single region or cloud provider ceasing service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"providingmorevaluefromourultimateapiservice\">Providing more value from our Ultimate API service</h3>\n<p>For customers that do sign up for API keys, we\'ve been adding more and more features to provide a better experience. <a href=\"https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-adds-geolocation-insights-for-dapps-and-api-apps/\">Geolocation insights</a> provide statistics about where in the world communities are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives.</p>\n<p>OnFinality is the only provider with <a href=\"https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-trace-api-for-unprecedented-visibility-into-your-dapps/\">Trace API</a> support, a huge and essential enhancement allowing unprecedented visibility for dApp builders. Trace API captures and records vital information otherwise not available through regular RPC methods and extrinsics (such as complete XCM transfer records and complete list of balance changes). These APIs are essential in order for <a href=\"https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinalitys-new-trace-api-helping-colorful-notion-get-trace-data-from-over-40-substrate-chains/\">developers like Polkaholic</a> and Parity\'s data team to parse and understand XCM transactions.</p>\n<p>We\'ve recently added support for 14 more Polkadot parachains as well as Osmosis, Evmos, Harmony, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fuse, DFK Chain, Celo, and Klaytn from outside the ecosystem. With over 100 supported networks, OnFinality is now the largest RPC provider worldwide (in terms of networks supported), and our ongoing expansion helps to bring more and more developers&nbsp; into the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"costoptimisation\">Cost Optimisation</h3>\n<p>OnFinality is very conscious about providing a strong level of support for Polkadot/Kusama at an extremely competitive price. In Q2 as we had the lowest cost per million responses across all of the major RPC providers that lodged a proposal to the Polkadot treasury (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Utw2HfS7I5Gpyhrl9ejuj0CrQ4AcChGFteXdw0a8tro/edit#gid=0\">source</a>).</p>\n<p>Cost saving measurement has been a significant focus on behalf of our customers, with advanced rate limiting controls implemented. We can, for example, rate limit each client on a burst and sustained basis and based on the request methods that they are calling (e.g. each state<em>traceBlock request is rate limited 45x more than chain</em>getBlock), <a href=\"https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/public-rate-limits\">read more about these advanced rate limiting tools that we\'ve developed here</a>.</p>\n<p>We continue to provide generous public API endpoints for over 40 different networks for common-good applications, while restricting access to high volume users that abuse the free service funded by this treasury.</p>\n<p>We\'ve <a href=\"1270\">developed and shared our approach towards service sustainability</a>, with the introduction of a \'Paid API Revenue Share Discount\' scheme. In this scheme OnFinality pools the revenue from customers that pay for higher API pricing plans and distributes this revenue pool to partners that currently pay for and own each API endpoint proportionally based on the number of paid API requests that go to that API endpoint. The scheme was introduced in Q1 of 2023 and recently resulted in a discount to <a href=\"82\">Polkadot\'s Q2 treasury proposal</a> of $1,364.38. The discount for Q3 will be calculated at the end of the quarter and applied to the Q4 treasury proposal.</p>\n<h1 id=\"servicedetails\">Service Details</h1>\n<p>In the last 3 months (2023-05-01 and 2023-07-31) our Polkadot API service has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Served a total of 2.7 billion (2,678,938,975) responses</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Accumulated over 41400 GB of data egress&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The highest daily total was 66&nbsp; million responses in a single 24 hour period for Polkadot only</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 21 million responses each day</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Westend had over 207 million API responses in the period</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Statemint had almost 80 million API responses in the period</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encointer&nbsp; had over 32 million API responses in the period</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Collectives had over 50&nbsp; million API responses in the period</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All time totals for Polkadot is 101,260,668,321 (101 Billion) since November, 2020</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of this period the 90 day uptime for Polkadot, Statemint, Westend, Encointer and Collectives was 100%, 100%, 99.66%, 99.99%, 99.99% respectively.

This post propose a comprehensive bounty program aimed at funding the fiat on-ramp service for 20 parachains and the onramp integration for Asset Hub in the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The on-ramp service has been a prominent concern within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, creating barriers to entry for new users. These barriers arise from issues such as fragmented token liquidity, high costs associated with listing on exchanges, and the lack of tailored solutions for substrate chains. To address these challenges, we have diligently researched and engaged in insightful interviews with a diverse range of on-and-off-ramp service providers, and have had extensive conversations with various projects within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In March 2023, we proposed an <a href=\"https://kusama.polkassembly.io/bounty/21\"><strong>on-chain bounty on Kusama</strong></a> to secure funding for the on-ramp of 11 assets on 10 parachains. The proposal outlined a strategic collaboration with Banxa, a leading on-ramp service provider, in the form of a bulk deal between parachains and Banxa. The selection of Banxa was a result of meticulous evaluation, considering factors such as technical expertise, extensive geographic coverage, supported payment methods, and competitive pricing.</p>\n<p>I am pleased to report that our previous bounty proposal received overwhelming support across the Kusama ecosystem, and the integration process commenced swiftly. Throughout the implementation, the bounty proposal was carefully supervised by a curator committee comprising experts representing various facets of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Building on the success achieved within the Kusama ecosystem, we now aim to bring this bounty program to Polkadot. Our proposal includes 15 assets on 14 parachains, notably including DOT and USDT on Statemint. We also request funding for 6 slots to allow parachains that are not already involved to sign up and take advantage of this service. Another highlight is the integration of Banxa&rsquo;s onramp service with the Polkadot Asset Hub. By adding these assets, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional payment systems and the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the integration of Banxa\'s fiat onramp service with the Polkadot Asset Hub holds significant implications. It would enable users to purchase assets supported by the Asset Hub directly with fiat currencies and then deposit these assets directly into a designated parachain address, without the extra steps of XCM bridging.</p>\n<p>We believe that this bounty program represents a pivotal step towards resolving the fiat on-ramp challenge, encouraging widespread adoption, and fostering a dynamic and inclusive ecosystem. We eagerly await your support and cooperation in making this vision a reality for the Polkadot community.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><strong>Costs breakdown:</strong> <br />&mdash; 1st Batch Token 14 Parachains: 147 000 USD <br />&mdash; Reserve funding for 6 parachains: 63 000 USD <br />&mdash; Asset Hub Integration: 84 000 USD <br />&mdash; Management Overhead: 32 040 USD</p>\n<p><strong>Total: </strong>326 040 USD<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Please see&nbsp; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17IuGI-lLKXpNgjdb5xKiDYCSdMmcQoPJhhv6EfGxiPw/edit?usp=sharing\"><strong>Link to Full Proposal</strong>&nbsp;</a> , and leave your feedback in the comment section below!<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>'),(897,2,141,44196,4,1,33,0,'0x709324084bc849115785b0f4a62c5bfb90b04e94b5b84d3159da97a0915f66d8',43,100,17170246,'13zTcqasJT4DnDgNjmsceACcuSjt4q2geEjtMprnGXCnuuh1',1,1693991652,4.24,1696442274,'13zTcqasJT4DnDgNjmsceACcuSjt4q2geEjtMprnGXCnuuh1',200,17172646,NULL,NULL,NULL,9815523,2164853,3184017,'Increasing Hiring Success in Polkadot by Missing Link','<h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Jx1spXTv79X_cT2ABooj6mkGd5uAoNEHt4lGQ4UknM/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">READ THE FULL PROPOSAL HERE</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/KUP7k5GzuE4?si=XyD413ti_XrcdN9J&amp;t=4724\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Attempts At Governance - Interview</a></p>\n<p>Talent Acquisition takes a significant amount of time, resources and mental capacity from teams that should rather spend their time building.

This figure reflects the sum of all wealth produced within Brazilian territory during that year, underscoring Brazil\'s importance on the global economic stage.</p>\n<p>Looking at the latest data, we can see that in the first quarter of 2023, Brazil\'s GDP reached BRL 2,556.5 billion.

They are being used as a data source for <a href=\"https://app.subsquid.io/squids\">Squids</a> and for efficient data exploration and ad-hoc queries. An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public <a href=\"https://github.com/subsquid/archive-registry/blob/main/archives.json\">Archive Registry</a>.</p>\n<p>The Archives, as performant data sources of historical on-chain data, are critical to the operation of backend APIs run by major projects in the Polkadot ecosystem (the list is not exhaustive):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polkassembly</li>\n<li>Talisman</li>\n<li>RMRK</li>\n<li>SubWallet (+ GiantSquid API)</li>\n<li>KodaDot</li>\n<li>Phala dApp</li>\n<li>Subsocial + Polkaverse</li>\n<li>Stellaswap</li>\n<li>Beamswap</li>\n<li>Polkascan (+ GiantSquid API)</li>\n<li>Calamar (+ GiantSquid API)</li>\n<li>Moonsama/Exosama</li>\n<li>Reef</li>\n<li>Manta Wallet</li>\n<li>ZooDAO</li>\n<li>Zenlink</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All archives can be accessed and queried via an web intuitive GraphQL interface and are often used as developer friendly replacement of a block explorer.</p>\n<p>For example, here&rsquo;s a query for the last ten transfers on Kusama blockchain run against the <a href=\"https://kusama.explorer.subsquid.io/graphql\">Kusama Archive endpoint</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/u/0/docs/ADP-6oF28QRWrAQx4x6nJNPA_fSg4c73ukxfq-ATwlJOaeMkFcveUEN3abJyXlkg0M5tgxMSU9_hY00ovl7JB0PIaZV25wlpNy9QiYTah8HYt1QcfnmUiLPz61vWbAjWe6yEsIrl_dVS68yi_skDsIhpTHtk0NqWhZ2HakawVgzv13cB0Zz2GFF1uD4WduGKh1cT71w21kf8XhbV9NU8bYkYjJht4UPz5CEmrc-J8V-1g6zjdMK0TWcbRtZE469tyZurbsR6hrxtz3AgcT-yBnIaFSR1RjuDt9cU4ON1EuhAYFfbt_hxKS5eJAmkJnoRN9b98lm3z-ENAW4F4lGD4eaefmLjW0Ni96jVwyx2-0qpj_FCU8M4Jv-ADArSOogQU6E4WMjJ0IXO0G0wvqcpJritTjnVfaMg1BWVP4coevffowL396wjU7-php3xXPT1cYJHRi9hob4LQQUYXeBz_oGA2mcZ-VTw8fonH_Q5H3MWRqaaPttS618JzrkVaeEGScCMF9qJ5tMwBeMFQ9rcG9njN1frHKgaco97oSsZsSygw-OsuCAyBta90ZmHWeHo3ZJqtRNBdE33rEzJlBvlVo4uCVbMnjE_64s5bz2-OQczY8bEdjD6v7g4awrLXZXwx1zdRnHkc5TZsnG65LhbYXzLus-n-drRCSuk-67GihaJrMul5IoKRgHaUJekuQVaFNnL4YhKAGOotb7tvvNCLdDtpfnwZdg_bhGrALNf8b4hGBfJL1_cHPeTeKj2IrsCBVz1cm7EQp6fx5VTXD3oJnwLkx09vmauHqlftCgqfzYjSvL5E2yWRHI5NZa5igjdV9UNPUvj_LB4-NvVx_RCofmUNjC62qj8AUYJH8z7RhIvGmpvpdesVlFgFqlB-VMhPd8emdb6l1089w7jrc3bODqhQuNtEbM\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Over the seconf Quarter of 2023 we\'ve provided a free public data indexing service for ~95 Substrate blockchains (some archives have been dismissed, new ones have been added), so that everyone interested in the projects can publicly access indexed data on Substrate Events, Extrinsics, Storage Items and EVM logs.

Notifi&rsquo;s platform offers the devtools designed for web3 projects to start sending near real-time alerts to end users. This allows web3 developers and marketers to create highly custom messages, enabling web3 teams to identify who to message and how the message is delivered. We are proposing a grant from the Polkadot Treasury that can cover the full cost of providing our services to both the Polkadot relay chain itself and its core ecosystem parachains. We believe that our platform can facilitate the increase in adoption of the Polkadot-native platforms by new and existing users in web3.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>\n<p>Notifi is Solving Building notifications and alerts within web3 is a key pain point for all B2C platforms given the decentralized nature of user onboarding experience via wallets. As soon as end users onboard onto web3 dApps, the connection between the business and the consumer are immediately disintermediated, where the web3 project is not able to contact the users directly to provide useful information. We&rsquo;re solving problems for two key groups of users: 1) web3 users, and 2) web3 builders and communities.</p>\n<p><strong>Offering</strong></p>\n<p>Notifi\'s Solution Notifi&rsquo;s platform bridges the communication gap between web3 projects and its communities by providing the dev toolkit and infrastructure designed specifically for web. Notifi&rsquo;s solution is a highly customizable, white-labelled communication platform that can be embedded natively into web3 dApps. Additionally, we&rsquo;re able to monitor and parse smart contract events at a very granular level, enabling custom notifications, including loan health, governance proposals and staking alerts that are unique to parachains / dApps, while also doing it at scale. Improved notifications and communications to end users ultimately drives user activation, engagement, and retention, which is crucial for the broader Polkadot ecosystem to continue growing and remain competitive.</p>\n<p>Over the last several months, we worked closely with Parity to engage with the core Polkadot ecosystem parachains and wallets, and we received tremendous interest from the broader community to provide our notification services to power dApps and parachains. 16 parachains, wallets and ecosystem partners have confirmed their need for Notifi&rsquo;s services and committed support for Notifi&rsquo;s grant proposal.</p>\n<p>We hope to work closely with the Polkadot community at large to receive feedback on our proposal. We also appreciate that the Polkadot ecosystem is a truly community-driven ecosystem and welcome and invite feedback from the community to let us know which parachains should be included in the first batch.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Please review our full draft proposal here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vKwN6yf9A_KNEwzw-XpTdBy-25U0fx9pkLGdvqn-DdA/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vKwN6yf9A_KNEwzw-XpTdBy-25U0fx9pkLGdvqn-DdA/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>'),(905,2,150,0,7,0,34,0,'0x11526702d9c9693d6e48c4a4fba41c2395b6c81cffd58202d05816644d65f169',3,100,17290978,'138MRRCFovYvetAhv37SnNsZoCVyghYoUArhBzMzKFfFGeMP',1,1694716506,4.07,NULL,'138MRRCFovYvetAhv37SnNsZoCVyghYoUArhBzMzKFfFGeMP',400,17293378,NULL,NULL,NULL,8454778,35169817,4291183,'Bounty: The Genesis Incentive Pool','<p>Hey Polkadot Community,</p>\n<p>Talisman is requesting that a bounty be funded to support ongoing development and marketing activities.

Instead of the treasury providing a subsidy for each individual roadmap item which we feel is a poor incentive that generates very limited value for the network. We believe a results based funding model is appropriate for Talisman as it creates a positive feedback loop that will compound the value we create for the Polkadot network over time.</p>\n<p>It is a large bounty, yes!

OpenBrush is a widely used tool being leveraged my numerous projects (AlephZero, Astar Network, Phala Network, SubWallet, Artzero, Abax Finance). <br />Consequently we were suggested by some of the tokenholders to request retroactive funding on Polkadot.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>\n<p>The purpose of OpenBrush is to grow the emerging WASM smart contracts field. As Gavin mentioned in this <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/25/polkadots-gavin-wood-webassembly-is-the-future-of-smart-contracts-but-legacy-evm-is-right-now/\">CoinDesk</a> article, WebAssembly is the future of smart contracts. Also, as was mentioned in the approved <a href=\"../post/1491\">WASM smart contracts bounty</a> currently smart contracts parachains lead the ecosystem in terms of market adoption. However, despite WASM tech having a lot to offer, it\'s not being widely used at the moment simply because of lack of proper tooling and ecosystem infrastructure products</p>\n<p>OpenBrush is a core infrastructure product, a starting point, and a base for every ink! dApp. 15+ production-grade teams and 3 parachains currently use OpenBrush. This proposal is a continuation of the development of the successful product, proposing the most developer-needed features, validated by market feedback.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>List of OpenBrush stakeholders &amp; users: </strong></p>\n<p>AlephZero, Astar Network, Phala Network, SubWallet, Artzero, Abax Finance, AZERO.ID, Panorama Swap, Andromeda Swap, ink!Whale, Interlock, ArthSwap, ZapFi, Liberum DAO, Kagla Finance, Starlay, Paras, Koda Dot, Pink Robot, Zstake and 100 + unnamed devs and teams in our Discord.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>\n<p>You can find our delivery report here: (feel free to find the initial fulll proposal there as well)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o_gPHNn1L3lDEglil3S7t-xdl00Gz66dUHKkfNM51a8/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o_gPHNn1L3lDEglil3S7t-xdl00Gz66dUHKkfNM51a8/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<p>The amount was calculated as follows: 60720$/4.093=14833.623 DOT</p>'),(909,2,154,22400,6,0,33,0,'0x27243c85f694689b440fdf00d1d1a8f480c7e715c44dbbfd83ce95bc64d065ec',42,100,17342981,'1pzhyYR9gLk3GmwRtQESLkJCUXazFsAESgcbTRLc9q9hNuy',1,1695028698,4.13,NULL,'1pzhyYR9gLk3GmwRtQESLkJCUXazFsAESgcbTRLc9q9hNuy',200,17345381,NULL,NULL,NULL,2523611,10716116,1264539,'Retroactive and future maintenance/development of Parachains.info','<p><strong>Proponent:</strong> PARACHAINS.INFO<br /><strong>DOT address:</strong> 1pzhyYR9gLk3GmwRtQESLkJCUXazFsAESgcbTRLc9q9hNuy<br /><strong>Requested Allocation:</strong> 92,160 USD (22,400 DOT)</p>\n<p><a title=\"Parachains.info\" href=\"Parachains.info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Parachains.info</a> provides users of the Polkadot ecosystem with a centralised repository of unbiased information regarding parachain projects and auctions.

This reduces incentives for Collators to act in a favorable manner and they may also be inclined to under-resourcing their hosts to save costs. Collators should receive funding for the provision of their services. Ultimately, this should be provided by the chain in a preferably sustainable manner. Implementation of such a system is a long-term solution. In the medium term, funding for collators can be provided by the respective Treasuries in the form of a bounty.

This post propose a comprehensive bounty program aimed at funding the fiat on-ramp service for 20 parachains and the onramp integration for Asset Hub in the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The on-ramp service has been a prominent concern within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, creating barriers to entry for new users. These barriers arise from issues such as fragmented token liquidity, high costs associated with listing on exchanges, and the lack of tailored solutions for substrate chains. To address these challenges, we have diligently researched and engaged in insightful interviews with a diverse range of on-and-off-ramp service providers, and have had extensive conversations with various projects within the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In March 2023, we proposed an <a href=\"https://kusama.polkassembly.io/bounty/21\">on-chain bounty on Kusama</a> to secure funding for the on-ramp of 11 assets on 10 parachains. The proposal outlined a strategic collaboration with Banxa, a leading on-ramp service provider, in the form of a bulk deal between parachains and Banxa. The selection of Banxa was a result of meticulous evaluation, considering factors such as technical expertise, extensive geographic coverage, supported payment methods, and competitive pricing.</p>\n<p>I am pleased to report that our previous bounty proposal received overwhelming support across the Kusama ecosystem, and the integration process commenced swiftly. Throughout the implementation, the bounty proposal was carefully supervised by a curator committee comprising experts representing various facets of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Building on the success achieved within the Kusama ecosystem, we now aim to bring this bounty program to Polkadot. Our proposal includes 15 assets on 14 parachains, notably including DOT and USDT on Statemint. We also request funding for 6 slots to allow parachains that are not already involved to sign up and take advantage of this service. Another highlight is the integration of Banxa&rsquo;s onramp service with the Polkadot Asset Hub. By adding these assets, we aim to bridge the gap between traditional payment systems and the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the integration of Banxa\'s fiat onramp service with the Polkadot Asset Hub holds significant implications. It would enable users to purchase assets supported by the Asset Hub directly with fiat currencies and then deposit these assets directly into a designated parachain address, without the extra steps of XCM bridging.</p>\n<p>We believe that this bounty program represents a pivotal step towards resolving the fiat on-ramp challenge, encouraging widespread adoption, and fostering a dynamic and inclusive ecosystem. We eagerly await your support and cooperation in making this vision a reality for the Polkadot community.</p>\n<p>Costs breakdown: &mdash; 1st Batch Token 14 Parachains: 147 000 USD &mdash; Reserve funding for 6 parachains: 63 000 USD &mdash; Asset Hub Integration: 84 000 USD &mdash; Management Overhead: 32 040 USD</p>\n<p>Total: 326 040 USD</p>\n<p>Please see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17IuGI-lLKXpNgjdb5xKiDYCSdMmcQoPJhhv6EfGxiPw/edit\"><strong>Link to Full Proposal </strong></a>, and leave your feedback in the comment section below!</p>\n<p>View <a href=\"../post/1891\">Discussion Post</a><br /><br /></p>\n<p>A bounty proposal for the same purpose has been live and running on Kusama, it has achieved both approval and notable success.

Spreading the Best Nominator Strategies through TOP Nomination Leaderboards','<p><strong>Reseath overview</strong></p>\n<p>Nominators hold a crucial role in Polkadot owing to the innovative NPOS approach. They fortify the economic security of the system with genuine decentralization through their constant actions to select the best nodes and personal commitment.</p>\n<p>This approach demands significantly more involvement and decisions from them compared to any other staking yield (L1, farming, etc.). To incentivize their contributions, economic tools are employed: nominators receive the highest APY in the market for successful actions, while strict disincentivization tools (loss of reward or slashing of personal stake) ensure adherence to the system\'s stability.</p>\n<p>This blend, along with the platform\'s openness, enables the realization of a high level of decentralization, offering true freedom of action for participants and full permissionlessness. Any DOT holder can enter the system, undertake tasks, and earn rewards for their successful completion.</p>\n<p>However, the attributes of decentralization, openness, and permissionlessness mean every potential or existing nominator must engage in continuous self-education and perpetual optimization of their role. The complexity and dynamism of the system, key actions specific to the Polkadot ecosystem, necessitate proactive engagement from the nominator\'s side with almost zero feedback loop (because of decentralization).</p>\n<p>Indirect data (that was partially available before this research) show that nominator behavior is somewhat suboptimal.

These utilize indexes from Polkascan Explorer and Subsquid API endpoints, so data can be queried and filtered that is not directly possible or very inefficient on the Substrate RPC.\n* New [runtime interface](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface/tree/az-runtime-interface): more intuitive approach to interface with the runtime functionality, this is planned to be available in the next major release.  \n* Added [support for ink! v4](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface/pull/347)\n* Added [SCALE type definitions](https://github.com/polkascan/py-scale-codec/pull/112) for upcoming `MetadataV15` in Substrate. (Full support is still WIP)\n* Added [multiple params as key support](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface/pull/351) for `query_map()`\n* Add support for runtime calls at other blocks than the most recent [#346](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface/pull/346)\n* Upgrade contract interface to support `WeightV2` [#337](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface/pull/337)\n* Updated [metadata docs](https://polkascan.github.io/py-substrate-metadata-docs/) for Polkadot & Kusama parachain and stand-alone runtimes\n* Technical support on [Github](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface/discussions) and in [#polkascan:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#polkascan:matrix.org) and [substrate.stackexchange.com](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/python) channels\n\nFor more details about deliverables see https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface/releases and https://github.com/polkascan/py-scale-codec/releases\n\n\n## Activity report\n\nDetails about time spent and cost breakdown can be found in the [Q2 & Q3 activity report](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-2023Q2-Q3.md).\n\n## Previous activity reports\n\n* [October 2020](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202010.md)\n* [November 2020](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202011.md)\n* [December 2020](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202012.md)\n* [January 2021](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202101.md)\n* [February 2021](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202102.md)\n* [March 2021](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202103.md)\n* [April 2021](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202104.md)\n* [May 2021](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202105.md)\n* [June 2021](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202106.md)\n* [July 2021](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202107.md)\n* [August 2021](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202108.md)\n* [September 2021](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-202109.md)\n* [Quarter 4 2021](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-2021Q4.md)\n* [Quarter 1 2022](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-2022Q1.md)\n* [Quarter 2 2022](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-2022Q2.md)\n* [Quarter 3 2022](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-2022Q3.md)\n* [Quarter 4 2022](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-2022Q4.md)\n* [Quarter 1 2023](https://github.com/polkascan/social-contract/blob/master/polkadot/treasury-proposal-008-report-2023Q1.md)'),(923,2,168,5233,4,0,32,0,'0x0afde1d6b3572c4e215bb661367e151d58bb46eb6ed9301fe9da196550e50acc',42,100,17505606,'152wswWPnwr1uLxqyENaesqjFtJcMwLT3dmrpb7KNt1PZ1PX',1,1696008246,4.08,NULL,'152wswWPnwr1uLxqyENaesqjFtJcMwLT3dmrpb7KNt1PZ1PX',100,17508006,NULL,NULL,NULL,4395,10854974,43403,'A French content hub for Polkadot Ecosystem','<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>I\'m Patrice, a French Polkadot ambassador and content creator.

I create content about Polkadot since two years on my website &ldquo;Tendances Crypto&rdquo;, on Twitter and with &ldquo;Polkadot Francophonie&rdquo; community on Twitch. I believe that we must all work together to create a decentralized web to protect our data and identities, and for me, Polkadot is the only way to build a decentralized space for everyone and every project.</p>\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>France is showing increasing interest in the web3, and major French brands are developing strategies to integrate this new sector (Carrefour, Axa, Adidas, PMU, etc.). However, they have limited knowledge of Polkadot at the moment. There are two main reasons for this: there is very little regular content about Polkadot in the French media, and there is also a lack of support for companies looking to enter the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p>To address this issue, it is necessary to create a true hub of French content to promote Polkadot and engage in a B2B approach to attract projects that can utilize Polkadot\'s technology. This approach will have five aspects:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A weekly newsletter on governance.</li>\n<li>A monthly newsletter on ecosystem news.</li>\n<li>A weekly thematic article.</li>\n<li>A chatbot that will use information from the articles and official Polkadot documentation, as well as parachains, to answer readers\' questions.</li>\n<li>LinkedIn posts to build a B2B audience.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goal of this content is to grow the Polkadot community in France, increase the readership of Polkadot-related articles, and expand the number of French companies willing to adopt Polkadot\'s solutions. This proposal will fund this content hub for ten months (44 weeks).</p>\n<p>You can find the full proposal <a title=\"Proposal Tendances Crypto\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16VF8amEqKPz62f7fRRCMs2SsvUe0PD1QZxLMvfjFpMo/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Patrice</p>'),(924,2,169,15,9,1,30,0,'0x36f5ed1973ed19f3b3810897ac54355812449d64a625ad671811204a2627e1e2',41,100,17510627,'15ouFh2SHpGbHtDPsJ6cXQfes9Cx1gEFnJJsJVqPGzBSTudr',1,1696038378,4.08,NULL,'15ouFh2SHpGbHtDPsJ6cXQfes9Cx1gEFnJJsJVqPGzBSTudr',1,17510637,NULL,NULL,NULL,239659,7506281,275958,'Need to get tip which is not executed in old gov','<p>See <a href=\"https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/tips/15649605_0x7045b376f208b9102cde994054c7772cb8ba5f297f3d96e42c3d21fd88c2606d\">https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/tips/15649605_0x7045b376f208b9102cde994054c7772cb8ba5f297f3d96e42c3d21fd88c2606d</a></p>'),(925,2,170,5000,4,0,32,0,'0x8bdf86b4326364d7d22aef21b7f982b7093095e30b4ef00a970d996c9e66157d',42,100,17518403,'16B44UW3iW8MBb7vHACpKriF7NNQ9cw4YMPT5n6wYJzfGySY',1,1696085076,4.10,NULL,'16B44UW3iW8MBb7vHACpKriF7NNQ9cw4YMPT5n6wYJzfGySY',100,17520803,NULL,NULL,NULL,167868,1494140,96917,'Coinsider Media Campaign for Polkadot','<p><strong>Proposer:</strong> COINSIDER</p>\n<p><strong>Address:</strong> 16B44UW3iW8MBb7vHACpKriF7NNQ9cw4YMPT5n6wYJzfGySY</p>\n<p><strong>Contact:</strong> @joincoinsider on Twitter</p>\n<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Around 6 weeks</p>\n<p><strong>Amount:</strong> Around <strong>$20,000</strong> including fees &mdash; <strong>5,000 DOT</strong> with DOT price at <strong>$4.00</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Team:&nbsp; </strong>1 researcher, 1 editor, 1 thumbnail designer, and myself as the writer/host</p>\n<p><strong>About me:</strong></p>\n<p>Hey everyone! I&rsquo;m Kevin, the founder and host of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/coinsider\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Coinsider channel on YouTube</a>. I&rsquo;m here today to propose to you a specialized content campaign for Polkadot and its ecosystem.</p>\n<p>First, I know what some of y&rsquo;all are thinking: &ldquo;Sigh&hellip; yet another content creator doing a proposal?&rdquo; And I hear you! But I want to make the case that we&rsquo;re not your typical content creator and that we&rsquo;re worth working with.</p>\n<p>So on our channel, we do around 1-2 videos per week, because each one takes 10+ hours to carefully research, script, and produce. If you watch some of our videos, I hope you&rsquo;ll notice how much care we put into them. Also, if you look at SocialBlade, you&rsquo;ll see that we&rsquo;ve still been growing during the bear market (albeit slowly), whereas other larger channels have stopped growing altogether. Furthermore, if you look at our views to sub ratio, you&rsquo;ll see that we&rsquo;re among the best in the crypto niche for channels above 100k subscribers. Anyways, I don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;toot my own horn&rdquo; too much, I just want to share with you these stats that hopefully point to how high quality our content is.</p>\n<p>But also, you might be thinking: &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be covering Polkadot organically instead of getting funding for it?&rdquo; Well I have covered Polkadot in the past and plan on covering it in my upcoming series as well. But, the videos I&rsquo;m proposing are a bit more niche and don&rsquo;t fit into any of my upcoming series, so that&rsquo;s why I was thinking to do these in conjunction with Treasury funding and you guys in the community. And I&rsquo;m pretty confident that these will bring solid exposure to certain parts of Polkadot that will end up benefiting the project and the community.</p>\n<p>Now the next question some of y&rsquo;all may be thinking is: &ldquo;Will you be able to make an impact during the bear market?&rdquo; Well I think so, and the reason why is because of the videos I&rsquo;m specifically proposing (see below). They are mostly evergreen videos that would still be relevant months later, so even if they don&rsquo;t go &ldquo;viral&rdquo; per se, they will still get more and more views as time goes on. Also, my existing audience likes Layer 1 blockchains, but I haven\'t really covered Layer 0s in-depth, so I think I can get some of them to start following Polkadot as well.</p>\n<p>So yea, this is my first proposal and I just wanted to do a smaller campaign to see if yall like the idea, and if I&rsquo;m able to do a great job, hopefully we can work together again in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal asks the Polkadot Treasury for funding of a total of <strong>3 high quality educational videos</strong> covering the following topics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Why Polkadot Is The Most Decentralized Project Out There (OpenGov) </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Top 5 Polkadot Ecosystem Projects You Must Know! </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Why 2024 Will Be A Gamechanger for Polkadot!

Both sides, the Moonbeam DAO and HydraDX DAO, will benefit from moving this proposal forward. With growing liquidity and number of listed assets in the HydraDX Omnipool, everyone will be able to gain access to a decentralized, permissionless and frictionless way to trade (or accrue value of) GLMR with high capital efficiency and low slippage.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Terms</strong></p>\n<p>GLMR will be provided as an LP position into the Omnipool - trustlessly and without losing control of the funds. The GLMR position can be withdrawn at any time by the Moonbeam governance and GLMR sent back to its treasury. All made possible by XCM. Important fact to realize is that this model is superior to alternatives, where teams have to spend capital to be listed on CEXes or aquire the other half of the pair for seeding common fragmented XYK pools on other DEXes.</p>\n<p><strong>Overall Cost</strong></p>\n<p>There is no direct cost for the treasury. The LP position if withdrawn can end up in a profit or loss which depends mostly on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OhKN-PDXpnjsC0sX9LALixvgFlvERGlaFqM_2uDMFJs\">Accrued trading fees and Impermanent Loss in Omnipool</a> 4 suffered during LPing.</p>\n<p><strong>Use of Treasury Funds</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Moonbeam governance approves &amp; executes a proposal to send 500,000 GLMR via XCM to the [HydraDX Omnipool account] (7L53bUTBbfuj14UpdCNPwmgzzHSsrsTWBHX5pys32mVWM3C1, a system account with no private key)</li>\n<li>HydraDX governance launches a council motion which is fast-tracked and enacted in 3-4 hours</li>\n<li>After step 2 is complete, GLMR becomes tradeable within the Omnipool.

It takes advantage of `system#remark` and IPFS to achieve the goal. Generall the work will include:\n\n- Manage user signed data and upload them to IPFS.\n- Organize IPFS CIDs and submit them to the correseponding chain with `system#remark` extrinsic.\n- Scan scripts for submitted remarks(CIDs).\n- IPFS content fetching to get content by CIDs.\n- Populate scanned data to business database and render it to fronted pages.\n- Integrate the fronted interaction into current implementation.\n\nWe will first implement it for post discussions and OpenGov referenda, and then observe how it will affect the governance process.\n\n![sima](https://github.com/opensquare-network/subsquare/assets/2264908/2ae8d598-8646-4108-b91c-f7deb2c0c01a)\n\n\n#### Delegation UI enhancement\nWe\'ve implemented some simple interfaces to show users\' delegation status and help them to set delegations. We\'d propose to enhance this feature with following user stories.\n\n1. As a user, I can select an address from a list of active governance participants to delegate. I should see their voting history, their governance participation rate, and their announcement, so I can make a correct decision.\n2. As a active voter who want to attract more delegation to me, I want to public an announcement to show my voting strategy, so token holders can decide whether they will delegate their tokens to me.\n\nWe will implement a more advanced UI for users better delegation experience. \n- There will be a dashboard to show current delegation statistics.\n- There will be a list of delegatee with their announcement, and users can sort them with various ways.\n- Any token holder can publish their announcement to attract delegations, and the data CID will be stored on chain with `system#remark`.\n- Token holders can view their delegation and been delegated status in a more direct way.\n\n![delegation](https://github.com/opensquare-network/subsquare/assets/2264908/406504b4-c286-48d5-8a76-7a1f17455f8d)\n\n\n\n#### On-chain governance deposit management\n\nSome amount of tokens have to be reserved if users participate some kinds of governance activities. For example:\n- Fund will be reserved after a user propose a treasury proposal.\n- A user has to deposit decision deposit to make a OpenGov referendum enter into decision period.\n- Some fund will be reserved if a bounty curator accept the curation.\n\nWe will implemente interfaces to help user view funds locked due to governance, and help them to submit on chain calls to refund the locked tokens.\n\n#### Whales statistics\n\nWhales are perfecting more important roles to affect final result of referenda, but it\'s hard for the community to summarize all whales and their behaviors. We propose to implement interfaces to help the community to track whales\' votes. We can see a list of whales which will show there balance, votes count, aggregated votes balance, and their votes history.\n\n#### Other enhancement features\n- To help user better view the call info on various referendum/proposal pages, we will implement another call data tree view which is similar with that on polkadot apps. We believe it\'s a good supplement to current table and JSON view.\n- [Delivered] Add circle packing view(votes bubble) to show democracy/referenda votes distribution.\n- [Delivered] Show OpenGov referendum confirmation attempts info so users can see the complete confirmation process in the whole decision period.\n- [Delivered] Support search on the votes popup, so users can find whether an address have voted a referendum.\n- Notification through telegram. Currently we support notification by email, and telegram support will provide users another choice to get notifications in time.\n- Bounty & child bounty info enhancement.\n    - Show bounty address on the detail page.\n    - Show bounty current balance, how much spent on the detial page.\n- Profile page enhancement.\n    - Show user balances on profile page, so users can see the vote weight of this user.\n    - Multisig check. An address maybe a signatory of one or more multisig addresses. We will scan data on-chain and extract signatories of all multisig addresses, and then show all the multisig addresses which an address is a signatory.\n- My vote view and management on referendum detail page. Previously we only show the on-chain storage vote info. In this proposal, we will support showing the info even it\'s removed, and we will also support removing vote.\n\n\n#### Budget\n\n|  Development   | Estimated hours  | memo |\n|  ----  | ----  |  ----  |\n| Off-chain discussion data decentralization  | 640 | 4 FTE * 4 weeks |\n| Delegation UI enhancement  | 480 | 4 FTE * 3 weeks |\n| On-chain governance deposit management  | 240 | 3 FTE * 2 weeks |\n| Whales statistics  | 160 | 2 FTE * 2 weeks |\n| Other enhancement features  | 640 | 4 FTE * 4 weeks |\n| Total  | 2160 |  |\n\n### Dotreasury\n\n#### Separate deployments for chains\n\nWe\'d plan to extend dotreasury to support the treasury statistics data in the whole dotsama ecosystem. Development plans includes:\n- Separate the deployments for each chain, so there will be kusama.dotreasury.com, polkadot.dotreasury.com. So it will become easier to integrate more chains with less code coupling.\n- Implement a page to show the whole eco treasury statistics on dotreasury.com. It will sum all chains\' treasury data and show them in various visualized components.\n\n#### Othe features\n\n- Previously we implemented spents by periods, we propose to implement income by perious, so we can know both the income/output data by periods.\n- Add a failed tab to treasury proposals list, so we can know which proposals are failed.\n\n#### Budget\n\n|  Development   | Estimated hours  | memo |\n|  ----  | ----  |  ----  |\n| Separate deployments for chains and sum the whole treasury of deployed chains  | 240 | 3 FTE * 2 weeks |\n| Othe features  | 72 | 3 FTE * 3 days |\n| Total  | 312 |  |\n\n![dotreasury-landing](https://github.com/opensquare-network/subsquare/assets/2264908/54eed4a7-93d0-4217-91f7-2f4544809415)\n\n\n### Off-chain voting\n\n- Dark mode. As more projects get to use off-chain voting, and there are more users, we think it makes sense to implement dark mode for better user experience.\n- Proposal template. This feature will enable space admins set a template for proposals to be created, which will make proposers follow space community rules for new proposals.\n\n#### Budget\n\n|  Development   | Estimated hours  | memo |\n|  ----  | ----  |  ----  |\n| Dark mode  | 80 | 2 FTE * 1 weeks |\n| Othe features  | 72 | 3 FTE * 3 days |\n| Total  | 152 |  |\n\n## Total budget\n\nPlease check above sections for details of each item.

We believe the proposed new features are beneficial to the whole ecosystem.\n- We added off-chain voting into maintenance request and propose to implement darkm mode for it, as it\'s accepted by teams for some kinds of off-chain governance scenarios.\n\n### How many users are visiting your products?\n![metrics](https://github.com/opensquare-network/subsquare/assets/2264908/11e566ba-efe1-40bd-a007-b80c892dc8b8)\n\n### What\'s your longterm plan and why your team?\nWe\'re a group of experienced developers who are dedicated in the dotsama ecosystem for more than 4 years. Our longterm vision is to build a decentralized collaboration network in web3. We are focusing on infrastructure building because we found there are not good enough infrastructure products in the ecosystem and they are necessary to all further products in the web3 world based on polkadot. Main topics we are focusing include data indexing, anaylyzing and visualization which we think will help the whole ecosystem understand how polkadot works.\n'),(944,2,173,130,4,0,30,0,'0x058283590ce9a3b8e19b1c77364495f2db782417eefc583d5a147396ac39af19',42,100,17543713,'12WdqGgMaXe31Z9YNDoWfyb1JqtzCmmLW7hYfG7rh9rbEpyf',1,1696236960,4.28,NULL,'12WdqGgMaXe31Z9YNDoWfyb1JqtzCmmLW7hYfG7rh9rbEpyf',1,17543820,NULL,NULL,NULL,453450,9090310,168389,'Dubbing Polkadot Decoded 2023 into Italian','<p>I am Elektro, a Gavin Wood fan, ambassador for Unique Network and a professional translator with many years of experience working with both large and small companies. I have the skills and expertise to handle this project in a serious manner.</p>\n<p>I want to emphasize that only now, as I see the treasury investing much more pragmatically in things that actually create value for Polkadot (and so for all of us), I felt confident to bring this project forward to the community, that is why the contribution I\'m requesting is very reasonable.</p>\n<p>I will undertake the costs of proofreading, audio editing, production, and voice-over recording myself. I\'m only asking for less than I would request just for a text translation.</p>\n<p>The final price per minute will be exactly $13.70, slightly lower than the initial requested amount in the discussion. I want you to personally compare this price to other high-quality contributors and the general market. This is in no way meant to create competition for others or to show off, but to emphasize that the contribution I\'m requesting does not actually cover the full cost of this project. It is not for my personal enrichment, but merely to partially cover the opportunity cost of starting this project - expanding Polkadot\'s reach to the Italian community and improving the weak areas in this field. To be multi-chain we must also be multi-lingual.</p>\n<p>This specific proposal is related to the first video of the Polkadot 2023.</p>\n<p>To keep costs as low as possible, I\'ve decided to not incur marketing costs for now. If needed, I will add them to the proposal for the next videos, making it work retrospectively for all previously posted videos as well. If possible, I will try to rationalize the costs even further for the next videos.</p>\n<p>Here is a summary of the biggest issues this proposal will solve:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Incomplete information</strong>: The information that reaches the Italian community is summarized briefly in Italian, which omits the complexity and details covered in the full discussions.</p>\n<p><strong>Chronological order</strong>: Information reaches the Italian community out of chronological order, arriving in pieces rather than complete concepts. As a result, summaries are posted in the wrong sequence, potentially causing confusion.</p>\n<p><strong>Misinformation</strong>: As information passes through the users with English proficiency, it may deviate from the original source, either unintentionally due to incomplete understanding, or deliberately to obscure, alter, or insert details that serve certain interests. This issue is particularly concerning in crypto groups unaffiliated with Polkadot, where language barriers could enable unfair competitive practices.</p>\n<p><strong>Language barrier</strong>: According to the latest EF English Proficiency Index of 2022, Italy ranks 32 out of 35 in Europe and only 13% of Italians speak English</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of content</strong>: There is a clear shortage of Polkadot-related content for Italian speakers. Translating this major event would be an important first step in addressing that need.</p>\n<p><strong>Subtitles</strong>: When Polkadot content is available in Italian, it is usually just subtitled. While better than nothing, subtitles can be distracting or demotivating for viewers. Providing full Italian voice-overs exponentially enhances the video quality and accessibility exponentially.</p>\n<p><strong>Inclusivity</strong>: Providing Italian dubbing also makes this content accessible to blind Italians who do not speak English..</p>\n<p><strong>Survivorship bias</strong>: While focusing on the English proficiency of the already existing Italians on Polkadot, we overlook potential newcomers deterred by language barriers. This is especially relevant as some Polkadot projects aim to seamlessly onboard users from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-lingual Polkadot</strong>: When Polkadot becomes widely adopted, it will be important to have key information and materials qualitatively translated into Italian (and other major world languages as well). High-quality Italian language resources need to already be available, since creating them takes time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Full proposal:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQ2lcBKiDD5lyhz7eokdlcdyxCqoB0dWPToFhvMl_HI/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQ2lcBKiDD5lyhz7eokdlcdyxCqoB0dWPToFhvMl_HI/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Original post: \"Hello everyone! I am reaching out because I\'m noticing that the Polkadot treasury is becoming more discerning in its investments. This has given me the confidence to propose my assistance in expanding Polkadot\'s presence in the Italian speaking market. I\'ve been a Polkadot enthusiast for a while now, and I\'m excited to also dive into the community discussions and proposals (hoping I do nothing wrong). I am a professional translator with years of experience in the sector. I have all the necessary tools and skills for a project like this. Inspired by the work of Sara (sprin), a Polkadot Ambassador who provided an excellent Spanish dubbing for Polkadot Decoded 2022. As I\'m relatively new to the space, I\'d like to offer a competitive rate of 14$ per minute. There are a total of 88 videos for Polkadot Decoded 2023, amounting to 1890 minutes. To gauge interest from the Italian-speaking audience and the Polkadot community, I\'m willing to dub one video from the compilation entirely for free. This will showcase the high-quality work I can provide. If allowed, I can also share my Fiverr profile, where I\'ve been serving clients since 2017. Before proceeding, I\'d like to know obviously if the community is interested in this proposal. If there IS some interest, I\'d appreciate guidance on the technical aspects of proposals (any recommended resources, links, tips, etc...) and any additional information I should be aware of or provide.

To hold a Non-Sufficient asset in a Polkadot Asset Hub wallet address, a corresponding Polkadot Asset Hub account needs to exist on-chain.

On Polkadot Asset Hub, users need to ensure that the receiving wallet address holds at least 0.1 DOT, which is the Existential Deposit for establishing a Polkadot Asset Hub account, prior to sending additional assets to the address. However, Sufficient assets can also establish a Polkadot Asset Hub account, such that the Existential Deposit in DOT is not necessary.

The SubQuery Common API has proven to be an invaluable tool for client applications, enabling seamless access to pre-indexed data that would otherwise be resource-consuming or challenging to query directly from the blockchain, such as operation history, staking analytics, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://subquery.medium.com/nova-wallet-builds-common-api-for-polkadot-9e56e28af4c7\">The partnership</a> between SubQuery and Nova has flourished over time, exemplifying a collaborative spirit that has enhanced the Polkadot ecosystem. Notably, Nova Wallet has seamlessly integrated support for the public SubQuery projects, specifically tailoring them to index transfers from both the \"assets\" and \"ORML\" pallets, as well as providing Staking &amp; OpenGov data. This innovative integration has enabled easy access and querying of this vital data not only for Nova Wallet but also for any stakeholders within the ecosystem.

Currently, this is composed of over 20 members from supporting parachains and teams including Ajuna, Apilon, Astar, Aventus, Gear Technologies, Moonsama, Moonbeam, Opendive, Tanssi, Unique, and Parity Technologies.</p>\n<p>We are asking you to consider releasing funding through the treasury, for the cost of Verification of the newly created Polkadot Unity SDK. In the proposal below we explain how an ecosystem-wide solution, branded as Polkadot Unity SDK can produce long-term value for dot holders, significantly increase the visibility of Polkadot as a contender in the web3 gaming space and tangibly help with onboarding new users onto Polkadot and our ecosystem of parachains and dApps.</p>\n<p><strong><br />The TLDR:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Background: </strong>At present, the Unity Asset Store does not feature any Polkadot-based solutions for its extensive user base of game and application developers. The platform does, however, offer verified solutions for other blockchain ecosystems such as Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, Flow, and Algorand. This omission represents a significant gap in the market and an untapped opportunity for Polkadot to establish itself within the burgeoning web3 gaming vertical.&nbsp;<br />(<a href=\"https://assetstore.unity.com/decentralization-hub)\">https://assetstore.unity.com/decentralization-hub)</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong>&nbsp;Ajuna, Apilon, Astar, Aventus, Gear Technologies, Moonsama, Moonbeam, Opendive, Tanssi, Unique, and Parity Technologies&mdash;have been actively working to address these challenges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Funding Request:</strong> We are seeking total funds of $175,000 from the treasury. Of this amount, up to $150,000 will be allocated to cover the cost of Unity&rsquo;s verification and publishing process for an ecosystem-specific Polkadot Gaming Software Development Kit (SDK) on the Unity Asset Store. It should be noted that these are straight pass-through costs to Unity Technologies. This transaction will be executed with Parity Technologies as the counterparty. In the case that the cost of Verification is below the requested $150,000, the remaining funds will be returned to the Treasury. The $25,000 will be allocated to cover the maintenance of the SDK for a period of 12 months. You will find a full breakdown in the sections below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Opportunity:</strong>&nbsp; The integration of a Polkadot Gaming SDK into the Unity Asset Store offers a substantial opportunity to bolster Polkadot\'s brand recognition among game and app developers. This will empower Unity and C# developers to initiate projects in the web3 games and decentralized applications (dApps) sectors, specifically within the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Technical Specifications:&nbsp; </strong>The proposed SDK is designed as a versatile, model-driven solution. It will facilitate the rapid generation of customized C# SDKs compatible with various chain types&mdash;including relay-, para-, and solo chains. This enables effortless integration with Unity, obviating any further requirements and effectively unlocking the entire C# development stack.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Part 2: BD/Marketing:</strong> To ensure the success of this project, comprehensive efforts are essential from both Business Development (BD) and Marketing. Hence, we have divided the proposals into Technical (Part 1) and BD/Marketing (Part 2). Once Part 1 is approved, a distinct proposal for Part 2 will be submitted. Discussions pertaining to Part 2 can be followed through this link. This approach enables the Technical Teams to commence implementation promptly, allowing 4-6 weeks for verification, while Parachain and Parity teams can concentrate on Part 2.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are confident that this initiative will significantly contribute to the growth and diversification of the web3 gaming vertical on Polkadot, providing both immediate and long-term benefits to all stakeholders involved.</p>\n<p>We look forward to your support in realizing this transformative project.</p>\n<p><strong><br />Importance and Implications of a Verified Polkadot Unity SDK</strong></p>\n<p>Unity is the preferred engine for 60% of games created across all platforms, and over 50% of Web3 games [<a href=\"https://webinarcare.com/best-game-engine-software/game-engine-statistics/\">ref1</a>, <a href=\"https://webinarcare.com/best-game-engine-software/game-engine-statistics/\">ref2</a>]. Additionally, the Unity Asset store is used by over 1.5 mio developers for a wide variety of applications in the creator economy, such as animation and architecture. By becoming a Verified Unity Partner, we can offer a reliable and trusted solution for Unity developers who want to build on Polkadot.</p>\n<p><strong><br />Advantages of Verified Partnership?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Trust and Credibility:</strong> A Verified Unity Partner status would establish Polkadot as a reliable, trusted option for Unity\'s extensive developer community.</li>\n<li><strong>Widespread Adoption:</strong> Being featured on the Unity Asset Store would dramatically scale the adoption of Polkadot SDK for both Polkadot and its parachains.</li>\n<li><strong>Exclusive Features:</strong> Verification grants access to specialized features like custom End-User License Agreements (EULA), thereby enabling subscription-based product offerings.</li>\n<li><strong>Focused Marketing Strategy:</strong> A Verified Unity Partner status allows for more effective and concentrated marketing initiatives.</li>\n<li><strong>Ecosystem Synergy:</strong> The verification of a parachain-agnostic SDK provides a foundation upon which individual parachain projects can build their unique offerings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><br />Problem: The Existing Gap</strong></p>\n<p>Currently, Unity developers lack an avenue for creating Web3 applications within the Polkadot ecosystem. This absence effectively sidelines a potential 1.5 million developers from considering Polkadot and its associated projects (relay-, para-, and solo chains) as viable platforms for Web3 applications.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the financial and resource investment required for individual projects to develop and verify their Unity SDKs would be substantial and would not benefit the ecosystem at large, creating inefficiencies and redundancies.</p>\n<p><strong><br />Collaborative Effort for a Unified Solution</strong></p>\n<p>Initiated in April of this year, our collective group&mdash;comprising over 20 members from organizations like Ajuna, Apilon, Astar, Aventus, Gear Technologies, Moonsama, Moonbeam, Opendive, Tanssi, Unique, and Parity Technologies&mdash;has been actively working to address these challenges through a unified approach to SDK development.</p>\n<p>We believe that our proposed initiative will significantly enhance Polkadot&rsquo;s standing within the Unity community, offering both immediate and long-term benefits to all stakeholders.</p>\n<p><strong><br />Proposed Solution</strong></p>\n<p>Objective</p>\n<p>Our primary goal is to introduce a verified Polkadot Unity Software Development Kit (SDK) into the Unity Asset Store. This initiative aims to provide game and application developers with a robust set of tools that will enable seamless integration of their current and forthcoming projects with the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This toolkit is not merely a software asset; it serves as a comprehensive development framework built on C#. It is designed to streamline the efforts of&nbsp;relay-, para-, and solo chain teams, enabling them to build, verify, and deploy blockchain-based solutions with ease.</p>\n<p>The technical development phase is already complete. What remains is to gain verification status in order to join the ranks of other notable SDKs in the <a href=\"https://assetstore.unity.com/decentralization-hub\">Unity Asset Store</a>, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Solana SDK for Unity</li>\n<li>Tezos SDK for Unity</li>\n<li>Metamask</li>\n<li>Flow SDK</li>\n<li>Aptos SDK</li>\n<li>Truffle</li>\n<li>and more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By achieving this, we aim to position our ecosystem Polkadot Unity SDK as a go-to resource within the Unity Asset Store, elevating its stature to that of existing, reputable solutions. The cost, as priced by Unity Technologies and equally applicable to all Verified solutions, is $150,000.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Specifications</strong></p>\n<p>Polkadot Unity SDK</p>\n<p>We propose to maintain and improve the Polkadot Unity SDK as a common foundational layer for all relay-, para-, and solo chain&nbsp;builders.

Published projects so far: GitHub - <a href=\"https://github.com/SubstrateGaming/Substrate.Chains.NET\">Substrate.Chains.NET</a></p>\n<p>Project-Specific Layers</p>\n<p>On top of the base SDK, developers can create project-specific layers to add unique features or functionalities tied to a particular relay-, para- and solochain.</p>\n<p>Technological Advantages</p>\n<p>The SDK will be akin to Polkadot.js but written in C#, thereby leveraging the Microsoft C# stack and the entire Unity stack for enhanced capabilities.</p>\n<p>Verification and Subsidies</p>\n<p>While the foundational SDK remains co-owned and reusable, individual parachain teams can apply for subsidies to add layers of verification or to create project-specific features. This approach ensures that the value derived from verification justifies the costs involved, and it keeps the competitive spirit intact among developers.<br /><br />Open-Source</p>\n<p>The development of the SDK is open-source, and feedback and suggestions on GitHub are welcome, making it a co-owned asset in the gaming vertical.</p>\n<p>Features and Capabilities</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Streamlined Development:</strong> The SDK is designed to simplify and expedite the development process for teams working on relay-, para-, and solo chains, allowing for the efficient creation, verification, and deployment of blockchain-based applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interoperability:</strong> With its parachain-agnostic architecture, the SDK will offer a foundational layer that can be customized by individual teams to add unique functionalities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Inclusion of Comprehensive Tools:</strong> The SDK will include a wide array of tools and resources to assist developers at every stage of the application development lifecycle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ease of Adoption:</strong> Due to its compatibility with Unity and the C# language, the SDK will be easily adoptable by a broad range of developers with varying levels of expertise.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By successfully implementing this solution, we anticipate significant advancements in Polkadot\'s standing within the broader Unity and web3 development communities.

We firmly believe that for Polkadot\'s Web3 gaming to truly succeed and achieve mass adoption, securing this milestone must be succeeded by substantial efforts in Business Development and Marketing. Achieving this is more than just delivering technical solutions; it&rsquo;s crucial to promote and expose it to both the Web3 and the prevalent Web2 gaming communities through various platforms like Gamescom or the GDC.</em></p>\n<p><em>Hence, a meticulous and impactful BD/Marketing strategy is indispensable, aiming to effectively onboard game studios, game developers, and end users to the Polkadot ecosystem. The realization of these promotional and exposure goals is inherent in Part 2 of our proposal, which is contingent upon the successful approval and implementation of this initial technical proposal. A subsequent proposal, intertwining with the success of the first one, will be presented for the Treasury\'s consideration, addressing the crucial components of branding, communication, and market penetration. By navigating through these structured phases, we aspire to forge a path that leads to not just technical integrations but also to widespread acknowledgment and acceptance in both Web2 and Web3 gaming spaces. Our conviction is that this approach is pivotal to unraveling the full potential of Polkadot in the gaming sector.</em></p>'),(955,2,178,37851,4,0,33,0,'0x4308d4f8f8a9028cf6e7cdb51ebf0e316f4dce98b5042625653b3bde68701edd',43,100,17571789,'1QjuTEKebQ3au8bxQC6iwYSPCA2iZn3YHwX8VABCauKtwRk',1,1696405560,4.05,NULL,'1QjuTEKebQ3au8bxQC6iwYSPCA2iZn3YHwX8VABCauKtwRk',200,17574189,NULL,NULL,NULL,159006,1206383,130970,'Dot Leap 2: Let\'s grow!','<h2 id=\"problemstatement\">Problem Statement</h2>\n<p>For the past three years, <a href=\"https://newsletter.dotleap.com\">Dot Leap</a> has been keeping the community in the loop about all governance, technical, and ecosystem news surrounding the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"1410\">last proposal</a> has helped us remain in operation, and we would love to be able to stay free of ads for products and services, and credibly neutral going forward, while renewing focus on growth.</p>\n<p>It is no secret (real, human) users have been stagnating across web3 - the community has been scared off, and the echo chambers are saturated.</p>\n<p>Metrics-wise, the newsletter had 3310 subscribers at the time of our last proposal, with a 30% open rate and 10% average clickthrough rate, which is almost unheard of in newsletter success metrics.

The bot will reply with information about the link, its assessed quality and relevance, and whether or not it was already submitted by someone else.</p>\n<h3 id=\"newsletter\">Newsletter</h3>\n<p>The newsletter will be reformatted to be less \"😐🥱\" (ugh) and more \"😳🤯😲\" (wow). So far, some of the problems were the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Github links were rarely clicked on unless controversial.</strong> To really explain those, the writer must understand what they do, and follow them meticulously. Under more technical leadership which can break these technical changes down in an easy to consume way, there is a good chance that these links will be made appealing to click on again.</li>\n<li><strong>Governance links lost clickthrough rates</strong> despite controversy because the outcomes have become predictable, while no interesting explanation is given for votes and outcomes. The lack of creativity in the proposals seems to also be a contributing factor. These need to be more thoroughly explained, but in a short and soundbitey way so that they do not look like skippable walls of text - people have enough to read and pay attention to already. Conclusions - economical, technical, and social - also need to be laid out, as not everyone is in Polkahaus :)</li>\n<li><strong>Focus is on the wrong metrics across all ecosystems.</strong> TX count or TVL are often mentioned, either in staking or governance locks, but real user count or actual transaction intents across parachains are rarely discussed (likely because they paint a worrying picture when <a href=\"https://cryptotrafficmarket.com/\">not gamed</a>). By shedding light on the problems, we believe we can make Dot Leap incredibly engaging to read again, while also helping solve some of those issues.</li>\n<li>Announcements, while they do sometimes lead pumpamentals and clicks, are ultimately meaningless. Dot Leap will only publish shipped collaborations, ignoring press releases and \"partnerships\".</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The initial plan was thus to create a subletter for Governance, Technical, and Ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Each version would mention key points of the other, but go into detail only about its own content. However, the readership seems divided on this topic, so this is still in the air.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1yi54vx6.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong><em>If</em></strong> it happens, we will pilot this in a way that does not dilute the content, and we will ask for feedback on every edition. The goal is to make the readers happy - the newsletter makes no sense otherwise - so if the community decides against it, they are in charge.</p>\n<p>Per majority vote, each version will also contain commentary on that week\'s most pressing or notable issues.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkTI5Vwla.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Per majority vote, each edition will also have a short video recap, for those who prefer to consume news in a video or audio format, auto-formatted and sliced in such a way that makes it easy to share the whole thing of parts of the video on social media.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syvw5VDxa.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Per community vote, each edition will also have a \"dogfood of the day\" section, guiding readers through something they should DO in Polkadot\'s side of web3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryxd9Eve6.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, each newsletter will contain a simple link to a feedback form at the end to gauge people\'s satisfaction with our work and solicit feedback or requests for changes of direction. This will be non-invasive, a simple 1-5 grade with a text input.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feeandpaymentterms\">Fee and Payment Terms</h2>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Item</th>\n<th>Expense</th>\n<th>Duration</th>\n<th>Note</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Website Growth, Expansion, Content</td>\n<td>20000</td>\n<td>12 months</td>\n<td>Web3 profiles, feedback mechanism</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Website Maintenance + AI tools</td>\n<td>~5000</td>\n<td>12 months</td>\n<td>Mostly hosted on IPFS, this comes down to pinning and alternative hosting costs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Newsletter Continuation</td>\n<td>80000</td>\n<td>12 months</td>\n<td>Daily research, keeping track of Github PRs and governance proposals across the ecosystem\'s many chains, commentary, event and community coverage, social media</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AI Integration</td>\n<td>~38000</td>\n<td>12 months</td>\n<td>Helper application for edition generation, social media conten</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ad Spend</td>\n<td>~12000</td>\n<td>12 months</td>\n<td>Purchasing placed ads on search engines and social networks.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Beneficiary Address</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1QjuTEKebQ3au8bxQC6iwYSPCA2iZn3YHwX8VABCauKtwRk</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price\">EMA7 rate by Subscan</a> will be used to calculate the allocation on the day of submission.</p>\n<p>The expenses cannot be more accurately predicted or broken down any further, anything else would be <strong>misleading</strong> the OpenGov community.</p>\n<p>There are many things to take into consideration, from salary and level of expertise of involved people, to tax ramifications (as an example, in Croatia the total comes down to something like 60% tax on these gross amounts), so these budgets are proposed in the minimum amounts needed to guarantee a successful outcome.</p>\n<p>This is a full time job, and despite the integration of AI (which itself might need a part time employee), <strong>at least one</strong> person fully embedded in this ecosystem will be monitoring it, parsing it, editing it, developing the helper tools and integrations, generating content for the website, and more. As such, this ask is mainly for <em>salary funds</em> (incl. tax) which will be distributed amongst the people working on this, and used to cover whatever infra expenses are incurred.</p>\n<p><strong>Work done so far includes a new template for the newsletter, reader feedback research, and an MVP of a helper application for link-heavy newsletters which auto generates summaries and social media threads along with growth hacking scenarios and data analytics.</strong></p>\n<p>We believe our track record and general favor of the community speak for our dedication and quality of work. The bear is the time for building, and we could not be more excited about telling the world about new Polkadot concepts, as well as keeping everyone up to date on all the upcoming changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kpis\">KPIs</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>15000 total subscribers before November 2024, Substack, X, Youtube, and Telegram Readership channel combined. On X, only Verified accounts will count as subscribers.</li>\n<li>20%+ open rate on the emails</li>\n<li>5+% average clickthrough rate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We believe this is in the realm of possibility. The open rates and clickthrough rates generally go down with subscriber base growth, and the more comprehensive a newsletter is, the less incentive there is to click through a link, but as we prune inactive emails (those that have not interacted with an email after several editions), these numbers should be attainable.</p>\n<p>The Telegram output and social media output, as well as the video recap might all nerf our numbers a little since those cannot count clicks, and there might be some duplicates (an X follower might also be an email subscriber) but this is why we are comfortable raising the subscriber count KPI target to almost 500% of the current number.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howwillwegrow\">How will we grow?</h3>\n<p>Which methods will be utilised for user acquisition and retention? How exactly do we plan to achieve such growth?</p>\n<h4 id=\"activecommunication\">Active Communication</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Notes and X: Regular thread-versions of the newsletter\'s editions will be published on X and Substack Notes immediately after publication, tagging relevant parties and prompting discussion. Both for X and Notes, most of the initial content will be automatically generated by AI, prompting passive growth, while active engagement will be used as a followup. This will include changes in staking %, governance info and numbers, and all the general content from the newsletter\'s edition, abbreviated and summarized, encouraging clickthrough.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Feedback form: The feedback form at the end of each edition will be useful to optimize future content according to the wishes of current readers. This alone should significantly increase retention and reduce unsubscribes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Announcement Channel and Link Group: Two Telegram groups will be set up: announcement channel for edition recaps, in case people prefer to consume the newsletter out of inbox, and a submission channel where DMing a bot will automatically insert a given link into the dedicated helper AI application. The application will keep score of submitted links, encouraging users to report fast and often.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"additionalreachandadcampaigns\">Additional Reach and Ad Campaigns</h4>\n<p>Due to publishing short form video content for every edition, we expect growth on Youtube and X. A tiktok presence will also be established and attempted. May Odin help us all.</p>\n<p>$1000 per month will be spent on Ad campaigns, A/B testing platforms, content, and copy text. We intend to leverage social media network ad placement for targeting audiences, as well as search engine ad placement to hijack popular search keywords.</p>\n<h4 id=\"gamification\">Gamification</h4>\n<p>While not for everyone, gamification has proven to be noticeably effective in certain demographics and user personas. Our aim is to give each reader who provides feedback a web3 profile on the Dot Leap website, and grow their profile with an evolving NFT, introducing reputation into the mix.</p>\n<p>Over time, these users will be the governing layer of Dot Leap, shaping more than just the content of the newsletter. As Dot Leap matures, it might take on additional roles - like validating or a nomination pool - and, inspired by ChaosDAO, these key actors will have an important voice in matters of governance.</p>\n<h4 id=\"collaborationandusercrosspollination\">Collaboration and User Cross-pollination</h4>\n<p>The Polkadot community is small and fragmented. A fabled legion of Asian devotees exists, yet they barely register on the western radar. The various outspoken entities already present in the ecosystem (Kusamarian, Polkaworld, Kryptoschain, Bill Laboon, Rob&hellip;) have their audiences, but generally these audiences are not shared.</p>\n<p>Our aim is to proactively seek out and collaborate with all of these entities and more - should they be willing - to encourage cross-consumption of material and grow the ecosystem\'s attention span together, rather than fragment it further. Dot Leap 2 is not a vampire attack on other media, but an augmentation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"lookingfortrouble\">Looking For Trouble</h4>\n<p>We intend to actively seek out discussions touching on the Polkadot outside the Polkadot ecosystem. We will look for discussions around concepts similar to what Polkadot has or is working on, and insert our content into the conversation, hopefully also gradually improving Polkadot\'s brand at the same time.</p>\n<p>We will publicly report on these attempts and ask our community for (non trolling, patient, and collaborative) help.</p>\n<h2 id=\"faq\">FAQ</h2>\n<p>I will attempt to frontrun some questions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whowillbedoingthis\">Who will be doing this?</h3>\n<p>At first, Bruno will be doing most of this, with some help from his brother on development matters. Someone more techincal and data-and-AI minded is needed to take the newsletter to its next level in terms of organic growth, and so we need to make staffing changes as much as infrastructural/content changes to get this growth in an honest way.</p>\n<h3 id=\"howcanyoudothiswhilerunningrmrk\">How can you do this while running RMRK?</h3>\n<p>I am barely useful at RMRK these days. As ops/admin, I am de-emphasizing my position there in favor of writing code again (any code - both RMRK-adjacent code and other stuff which includes Dot Leap related development) and getting more familiar with the technical side of various ecosystems, which is also a part of what I must do for RMRK\'s benefit as it expands.</p>\n<p>I am plugged into web3 18 hours a day as is, and dedicating time to making Dot Leap into the behemoth I know it can be is a worthy challenge that can benefit all parties. I will, however, aim to replace myself at the first opportunity.</p>\n<p>Dot Leap is a separate entity, and hopefully one I can pass on to someone else after setting it up <strong>the way I would like to be reading it.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"arentyouapolkadothaternow\">Aren\'t you a Polkadot hater now?</h3>\n<p>I have my gripes with the brand and various entities in the ecosystem. None of that means I disregard the tech that comes out of this ecosystem, or that my journalistic integrity is compromised. I have been in tech writing and journalism for well over 12 years now, 9 of those in web3, always delivering objective reports. This will continue.</p>\n<p>I am still deeply invested in this eco, in more ways than one, and I like to be kept in the loop on things as much as the next tokenholder. I might as well do a good job of forwarding the information while absorbing it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whathappenstodotleapifthisproposalfails\">What happens to Dot Leap if this proposal fails?</h3>\n<p>I will attempt to seek out sponsorship and integrate ads. Failing that, I will shut down Dot Leap and NFT Review.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whynotrequestthisinmilestonesorasabounty\">Why not request this in milestones or as a bounty?</h3>\n<p>The planned changes are truly vast, and their expenses unpredictable. A smaller amount at first might not be enough to get critical mass of development early on, and the uncertainty might dissuade people we might want to hire from applying.</p>\n<p>In theory, this could be done in smaller instalments, but these are not constraints under which I would personally be comfortable with leading this.</p>\n<h3 id=\"willyoujustmarketdump\">Will you just marketdump?</h3>\n<p>The funds will be staked and only sold as necessary for expenses. For the most part I will pay for everything out of pocket and reimburse my costs periodically, in an effort to gain as much as possible from the stake.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contact\">Contact</h2>\n<p>Telegram: t.me/swader</p>\n<p>email: <a href=\"mailto:bruno@bitfalls.com\">bruno@bitfalls.com</a></p>'),(956,2,179,255835,5,0,34,0,'0x8609284cd0c813e1fb98dc50a913c1b7a74f8d9cba4f32309d89656671e64bdf',43,100,17576346,'1njGozmydXftj6KYFPGLPN7Qq3kgmFqxsRdF5hWJAschp1S',1,1696432992,4.02,NULL,'1njGozmydXftj6KYFPGLPN7Qq3kgmFqxsRdF5hWJAschp1S',400,17578746,NULL,NULL,NULL,2573427,1184396,1148619,'Polkadot Blockchain Academy - retroactive funding for wave 3 of the Academy held at UC Berkeley this Summer.','<p>On behalf of the Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA) I am posting this treasury proposal for retroactive funding for the third wave of the Academy. The Polkadot Blockchain Academy at UC Berkeley ran from July 10th to August 10th 2023, in partnership with the Berkeley RDI centre.

(Big Tipper)','**Proposer:** Cryptozilla (Max)\n\n**About Me:** I am Max, I am a Polkadot Ambassador and I run [Cryptozilla YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CryptozillaKH/videos) focused on Polkadot. Since August 2021, I have released 233 videos about Polkadot & Kusama. My video content aims to educate about the Polkadot ecosystem, its technology and Web3 vision.\n\n**Requested Amount**: 980 DOT ($4,000, with DOT at $4.076, [EMA7](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)).\n\n**The purpose of the proposal**: Tip for the production of 25 English educational videos about Polkadot (10 videos retroactive).\n\n**Contact:**  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cryptozilla_mg), Telegram: @MaxTheo, Discord: MaxTheo, Email: cryptozillamax@gmail.com\n\n→ [3 min. explainer video of my treasury proposal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX_JuthQVPc) \n\n---\n\n**Brief Info:**\n\nHello, this is Max (Polkadot Ambassador & [Cryptozilla YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CryptozillaKH/videos)) and this is my treasury proposal to request a tip (980 DOT) for the production of 25 English educational videos about the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n\n**Cryptozilla YT Channel Introduction:**\n\n**Over more than 2 years, I have released 233 English educational videos about Polkadot & Kusama, including more than 35 ecosystem dApps tutorials. All video content totalling over 30 hours.** Thanks to my long-term effort to create quality video content about the Polkadot ecosystem, my YT channel has become one of the biggest channels focused on Polkadot. **All my video content received more than 466,000 views to date** (see KPIs in [the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jn_B-t_6HJ70LIvF1XYzwCDjvd9DHvls/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109251064373401876264&rtpof=true&sd=true)).\n\n**The purpose of this proposal:**\n\nWith this proposal I ask the Polkadot Treasury for a tip (**980 DOT**) for the production of **25 English educational videos**. **The proposal is partially retroactive, as 10 videos have already been delivered.** The funds will also serve as a reward for the production of 15 more videos about Polkadot on my YT channel. \n\n**Requested DOT amount & video cost:**\n\n**I set the cost of each video at $160, hence I ask for $4,000 worth of 980 DOT, with DOT price at $4.076,** [EMA7](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price))\n\n**10 Delivered videos:**\n\n1.

So far I have made 4 of them: \n**Polkadot vs Ethereum, Cosmos, Avalanche, Cardano.**\nI believe that comparing Polkadot with other ecosystems is one of the most efficient ways to introduce Polkadot also to other blockchain ecosystems communities. I am going to compare Polkadot with all the major ecosystems.\n\n**The vision of my YT channel:**\n\nThe main focus of my channel will remain on producing detailed ecosystem dApps tutorials as well as to educate about Polkadot’s technology and its Web3 vision. I don’t do sponsored videos. The purpose of my channel is to educate about Polkadot and be viewed as a resource of trustworthy information about the Polkadot eco for the existing community as well as for newcomers to the Polkadot space.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX_JuthQVPc) you can watch 3 min. explainer video of my treasury proposal.\n\nThe prior discussion can be found [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1929).\n\nI provide all the necessary information & Cryptozilla channel KPIs in [the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jn_B-t_6HJ70LIvF1XYzwCDjvd9DHvls/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109251064373401876264&rtpof=true&sd=true).\n\nThank you for considering my treasury proposal, I am happy to answer all questions.\n\nMax (Cryptozilla)\n\n'),(962,2,185,90540,0,0,33,0,'0xb4bc7e2f262b4bfcd15cb308747f4577fe148b34d050971971a268ff7af64265',43,100,17630275,'12BJTP99gUerdvBhPobiTvrWwRaj1i5eFHN9qx51JWgrBtmv',1,1696757640,4.03,NULL,'12BJTP99gUerdvBhPobiTvrWwRaj1i5eFHN9qx51JWgrBtmv',200,17632675,NULL,NULL,NULL,39122,35050,21706,'Proposal：Polkadot Hackathon 2023 Winter in HongKong','Proponent:OneBlock+\n12BJTP99gUerdvBhPobiTvrWwRaj1i5eFHN9qx51JWgrBtmv\n\nRequested Allocation: $368,499 USD | 90,540 DOT\n\nOneBlock, in collaboration with Parity Asia, successfully organized, operated and promoted the 5 Hackathon competitions: [the Spring 2021 Shanghai](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/52.), [the Summer 2021 Hangzhou](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/62), [the Summer 2022 Hangzhou](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/110), [the Winter 2022 Chengdu](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/302), and [the 2023 Shanghai](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/36),**with over 200 teams and 800+ developers signing up to participate.**\n\nEach competition has seen a growing number of participating projects, with as many as 80 participating projects at the 2023 Shanghai, a 67% increase from the previous one, and 15 winning projects, an 88% increase from the previous one. It can be seen that the Hackathon hosted by the OneBlock+ community continues to be popular among developers, **and the popularity and popularity of the Polkadot Hackathon reached a leap in 2023.**\n\nWith all the operational experience and marketing success on the Polkadot Hackathon, OneBlock proposes to continue the Polkadot Hackathon program in November 2023 to January 2024, an essential part of the Substrate and Polkadot promotion and adoption initiatives in APAC,to promote Substrate as an open-source framework for developers and convert the Substrate learners from OneBlock’s ongoing Substrate courses to Substrate builders. Our goal is to encourage teams of developers to create projects and join the Polkadot ecosystem for long-term involvement. Additionally, we propose hosting the Hackathon Final Demoday in mid-January 2024 in Hong Kong, providing participants with the opportunity to simultaneously register for the PBA Hong Kong course will enhance their understanding of Polkadot.\n\nWe are currently in the midst of preparations for the Polkadot Hackathon Winter 2023, for which we are requesting $368,499 (90,540 DOT) from the Treasury. **5/6 of the fee is to reward the hackathon winners for their hard work and contribution in this hackathon, and 1/6 of the fee is to reimburse us for the operating expenses of hosting the hackathon.**\n\nPlease review our proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nU6nq1OF3O8_14W1AkPOpWx-chlL9hS8Ya52zskaHW0/edit) and cast your vote!');
